World leaders have congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after he won re-election in a historic run-off that posed the biggest challenge to his 20 years in power. Erdogan won Turkey’s presidency with 52.14 percent of the votes, said the head of the Supreme Election Council, Ahmet Yener, on Sunday, making the results official. The elections, in which more than 64 million Turks at home and abroad were entitled to vote, took place against a background of a cost-of-living crisis that saw inflation peak at 85 percent in October and earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 people. NATO member Turkey’s longest-serving leader was tested like never before in what was widely seen as the country’s most consequential election in its 100-year history as a post-Ottoman republic. Maulvi Abdul Kabir, the caretaker prime minister, said: “I congratulate President Erdogan on winning the Turkish election and on being elected president of Turkey.” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wished Erdogan a “good term with a lot of work” for the Turkish people. French President Emmanuel Macron said France and Turkey “will continue to move forward”. “France and Turkey have huge challenges to face together. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi called Erdogan’s re-election “a sign of continued valuable trust of Turkish people”. “Our relationship with Turkey in the next stage will continue on the basis of good neighbourliness and shared interests,” he added. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah described Erdogan’s “election victory” as a renewal of the Turkish people’s confidence in the president’s successful projects and policies. Dbeibah’s Tripoli-based Government of National Unity is backed by Turkey against an eastern-based rival government. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh lauded Erdogan and the Turkish people for their “election victory”. The head of Hamas’s political office Ismail Haniyeh said: “I congratulate President Erdogan on winning and I applaud the [Turkish] people’s civilised stance.","World leaders congratulate Turkey’s Erdogan on election win All eyes were on NATO member Turkey ahead of its pivotal poll as Erdogan fended off the biggest challenge to his rule.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on February 6 has killed more than 46,000 people, with the likelihood of finding survivors after two weeks extremely remote. The head of Turkey’s disaster management agency, Yunus Sezer, on Sunday said search and rescue efforts had been completed in all provinces apart from Hatay and Kahramanmaras, the earthquake’s epicentre. Sezer also said Turkey’s death toll had risen to 41,020. Some 105,794 buildings checked by Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Urbanization are either destroyed or so badly damaged as to require demolition, the ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The figures were for Turkey and did not cover collapsed and damaged buildings in neighbouring Syria.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on February 6 has killed more than 46,000 people, with the likelihood of finding survivors after two weeks extremely remote. The head of Turkey’s disaster management agency, Yunus Sezer, on Sunday said search and rescue efforts had been completed in all provinces apart from Hatay and Kahramanmaras, the earthquake’s epicentre. Sezer also said Turkey’s death toll had risen to 41,020. Some 105,794 buildings checked by Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Urbanization are either destroyed or so badly damaged as to require demolition, the ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

Reflecting on his childhood, Orga remembers eating melon, on ice, on a silver plate when he first heard the drums of war – those that announced, all over Istanbul, that the first world war had begun. For him and others in Turkey, nearly a decade of violence would follow. This memoir captures the founding years of the Turkish republic and the pain of those who lived through it, as Orga describes his wealthy Ottoman family’s descent into poverty and humiliation. Set in early republican Istanbul, Tanpinar’s novel was a groundbreaking satire of the politics of early Turkey – namely, the project to modernise the nation, with reforms at once liberating and overbearing. “The evening unfurled like a ribbon,” he writes, describing Istanbul’s sunsets, “whose colours ran from wine dark to golden.” Turkey’s best loved and coolest poet, Hikmet was a communist imprisoned in Turkey and exiled to Moscow, whose work was officially banned in the country of his birth for years. His poetry is known for its human scale, for the stories of everyday people told in everyday Turkish (and translated brilliantly here). Perhaps the defining change in Turkey over its second half-century can be summed up by one fact: in 1950, Istanbul’s population was around one million; today it stands at 16 million. In 2016, writer Altan was arrested and sent to prison, along with his brother and tens of thousands more – the victims of Turkey’s purges after its failed attempted coup. And so, over a period of seven months, he smuggled out handwritten notes to his lawyers, slowly putting together a memoir of his time in Silivri, Turkey’s biggest and most notorious jail.

Erdoğan, who previously lashed out at the US ambassador Jeff Flake for publicly meeting with Kılıçdaroğlu, has declared that “Turkey will give a message to the west with this election.” His interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, went even further, describing the vote on 14 May as “a political coup attempt by the west”. Under Erdoğan’s leadership, Turkey transformed into a presidential system supported by a vast patronage network loyal to his Justice and Development party (AKP), rebuffing an attempted military coup in 2016 and often branding his opponents enemies of the state.

Erdogan arrived in Saudi Arabia on Monday, accompanied by an entourage of some 200 businesspeople, according to the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey, as part of a three-stop tour of the region. Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attended the signing ceremony for the drones deal between Turkish defence firm Baykar and the Saudi defence ministry, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. Erdogan’s visit comes as Turks are hit with sales and fuel tax hikes that Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has said are necessary to restore fiscal discipline and bring inflation down. Turkey’s current account deficit reached record levels this year – $37.7bn in the first five months – and Erdogan hopes the oil and gas-rich Gulf states will help plug the gap. On Tuesday, the Turkish lira weakened to a record low of 26.6 against the dollar as investor attention began to focus on the central bank’s policy-setting meeting on Thursday where it is again expected to hike rates. Turkey has recently repaired ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following a decade-long rift after the 2011 Arab Spring and Ankara’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood, considered a threat by some Gulf monarchies. Worsening relations were exacerbated by a boycott of Turkish ally Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain in 2017. The 2018 murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul led to a further souring of ties with Riyadh. Qatar and the UAE have provided Turkey with some $20bn in currency swap agreements recently, while Saudi Arabia deposited $5bn into Turkey’s central bank in March. Days after Erdogan won re-election last month, the UAE and Turkey signed a trade deal potentially worth $40bn over the next five years.","Saudi Arabia buys Turkish drones during Erdogan’s visit Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy Turkish drones, one of several lucrative contracts President Recep Tayyip Erdogan secured for Turkey’s struggling economy as Ankara reaps the benefits of his recent diplomatic push to repair ties with Gulf Arab powers.

Turkey is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC, but the Turkey Tribunal, an investigative body set up in 2020 by lawyers and human rights groups to collate evidence and witness testimonies, said that at least some of the alleged crimes were carried out on the territory of 45 ICC member states, as Turkey has pursued its perceived enemies well beyond its borders. The ICC presentation says there were 17 cases of enforced disappearance in which victims were abducted from Kenya, Cambodia, Gabon, Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Mongolia and Switzerland and taken back to Turkey. The targets were linked to the opposition movement, led by US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, designated as a terrorist organisation after Gülen was accused of being behind a failed coup attempt in 2016, which was followed by hundreds of thousands of arrests inside Turkey. Karaca, aged 49 at the time, is a Turkish-born teacher, who had been a school headteacher in Cambodia before moving to Mexico in 2011 where he was a college principal until late 2018. He had feared that he was being watched by Turkish intelligence because he had been working in a school linked to the Gülen movement. After being held incommunicado for four days, Karaca was handed over to Turkish authorities who flew him back to Turkey on a small government jet. He was convicted of leading an armed terrorist group in the 2016 coup attempt, despite the fact he had left Turkey for Cambodia in 2002. The tribunal says Karaca is just one of many Turks living abroad who have been designated as “terrorists” because of links to Gulenist schools or other institutions. The Turkish foreign minister has so far not responded to a request for comment. The Turkey Tribunal points out there is a precedent for investigating the crimes of a non-signatory state. In the case of Turkey, it argues, “the crimes were committed on the territory of 45 party states, for which the ICC has territorial jurisdiction.","ICC asked to investigate Turkish government over persecution of opponents around the world The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague is being asked to investigate the Turkish government for alleged crimes against humanity in its pursuit and persecution of opponents around the world. “Turkish officials have committed crimes against humanity against hundreds of thousands of opponents of the Erdogan regime,” the submission says.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged Turkey not to veto Sweden’s bid to join the military alliance, ahead of a meeting this month to try to overcome objections delaying Stockholm’s membership. “Membership will make Sweden safer but also make NATO and Turkey stronger,” Secretary-General Stoltenberg told journalists in Istanbul on Sunday after meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his newly appointed foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, the former head of the intelligence agency. Officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland will meet next week to attempt to resolve the issues that have delayed Sweden’s NATO membership, said Stoltenberg, referring to the permanent joint mechanism set up to address Turkey’s concerns about Sweden and Finland. In March, Turkey ratified Finland’s bid for membership, and it became NATO’s 31st member in April. Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too lenient on “terrorist” organisations and security threats, including Kurdish groups and people associated with a 2016 coup attempt. “Sweden has taken significant concrete steps to meet Turkey’s concerns,” said Stoltenberg, noting that the country has amended its constitution, strengthened its anti-“terror” laws, and lifted an arms embargo on Turkey since it applied to join NATO just over a year ago. As Stoltenberg held talks in Istanbul, hundreds of people, including dozens of pro-Kurdish protesters, gathered in Stockholm to demonstrate against Sweden’s planned NATO membership. “I understand it is hard to see demonstrations against Turkey and against NATO in Sweden,” Stoltenberg said.

Ahead of Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14, he has been training volunteers to work as election observers at polling stations across the region of Hatay. The elections, in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces the biggest challenge to his two decades in power, are taking place three months after earthquakes destroyed parts of southern Turkey and northwestern Syria. Nearly 51,000 people died in Turkey alone. Turkey’s High Election Board (YSK) said earlier this year that only 133,000 people from the earthquake region have re-registered to vote elsewhere. “The election could have been delayed, or the city could have been given special status,” Karatas said, reflecting a feeling voiced by many displaced voters across Turkey, who think they should have been able to vote for their local parliament member in Hatay without having to face the logistical challenges of travelling back. The opposition has said it aimed to reverse the president’s unorthodox economic policies, largely blamed for the freefall of the Turkish lira against the dollar and runaway inflation. It also pledged to do away with the presidential system introduced after a referendum in 2017 and restore Turkey to a parliamentary democracy. He returned from Ankara a week back for the elections. “I think I will go to Eskisehir [a city in northwest Turkey], for one or two years,” he said, “I’ll do anything, any job. As half of the citizens of Turkey look at the coming days with hope for a turning point in their country’s history, residents of Antakya look at their devastated city and wonder how long it will take before it is rebuilt.","Turkey’s Antakya gears up to vote amid earthquake devastation Antakya, Turkey – Ali Bilgin stayed behind in Antakya after devastating earthquakes on February 6 triggered an exodus from the city in southern Turkey.

Imamoğlu’s 2019 victory was a landmark moment for Turkey’s opposition, marking him as Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s political enemy and giving fresh hope for those seeking to challenge his rule. Erdoğan, who held the post of Istanbul mayor decades earlier, had disputed the initial vote and demanded a re-run – resulting in a bigger win for Imamoğlu second time around. The Turkish president now aims to bring the country’s largest city back under his party’s control, after fending off the most concerted challenge to his rule in decades during national elections last year when his coalition also unexpectedly won a parliamentary majority. But, she conceded as she clutched a Turkish flag, opposition voters are struggling to muster the same enthusiasm as they did five years ago. Behind him was a new tramline inaugurated by Imamoğlu, and across the waters of the Bosphorus he had a clear view of one of the Istanbul mayor’s flagship projects, a former shipyard due to become a sleek mall complex.

While Imamoğlu has become the face of Turkey’s beleaguered opposition, the sense of enthusiasm and hope for change that propelled him into office has dissipated, particularly after a six-party anti-Erdoğan coalition that united to oppose the president was defeated in elections last year and the mood among his voter base is grim. Unlike in 2019, the Istanbul mayor is running without the backing of the nationalist IYI (Good) party, leaving him to campaign alone. Only the sense that Erdoğan’s determination to retake Istanbul makes him Imamoğlu’s true opponent, rather than Kurum, is drawing some voters to the polls.","‘People don’t believe they can win’: apathy abounds ahead of Istanbul’s mayoral election Ekrem Imamoğlu’s 2019 victory was a big moment for Turkey’s opposition – but five turbulent years as Erdoğan’s enemy have taken their toll On the banks of Istanbul’s Golden Horn, the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoğlu, rallied a crowd for his re-election campaign as banners advertising his opponent flapped in the breeze on a nearby bridge. “We brought prosperity to Istanbul,” he proclaimed, drawing cautious applause.

Istanbul, Turkey – Earthquake fever has gripped Istanbul since last year’s disaster in southern Turkey, as residents in Europe’s most populous city fear they could face similar devastation. The city lies near the North Anatolia faultline, a geological danger that has seen Istanbul hit by at least 34 strong earthquakes over the last 2,000 years. Smaller tremors can be felt by people in Istanbul every year – an ominous reminder of the danger that lurks beneath their streets. For many, witnessing the stark devastation caused to swaths of Turkey last February added to their anxiety over the inevitable but unpredictable arrival of “the big one”. Istanbul’s official population is 16 million, but estimates based on household water consumption by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality put the figure at 20 million. Those built before 1999 – the year a powerful earthquake in the eastern Marmara Sea rocked Istanbul, killing 18,000 people – are considered particularly at risk. Istanbul is Turkey’s finance and trade powerhouse – last year it accounted for more than half of Turkish exports – and such a blow would ravage the country’s economy. Okan Tuysuz, a professor at Istanbul Technical University’s Eurasian Earth Sciences Institute, said the North Anatolia fault could be expected to generate a quake of magnitude 7.5. “Serious damage may occur in Istanbul, especially on the coasts facing the Marmara Sea,” he said. Murat Kurum, the mayoral candidate for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party), is aiming to recapture Istanbul from Imamoglu, the Republican People’s Party politician who took it in 2019. “We see that this time the focus of the campaign is earthquake and urban transformation,” Ozer Oz, a board member of Istanbul’s Chamber of Civil Engineers, said. “However, the earthquake danger for Istanbul has not just emerged. Kurum served as minister for environment, urbanisation and climate change between 2018 and 2023, a role central to preparing Turkey’s cities for disaster. Critics highlighted a building amnesty during his period in office when more than three million building registration documents were issued across Turkey to those who paid a fine rather than bringing their buildings up to code.","Earthquake fever grips Turkey’s Istanbul amid fears of ‘the big one’ People of Istanbul have long feared the advent of a monster earthquake but it’s hard, and scary for some, to prepare for it.

Or Elif Shafak’s novels, which highlight the difficulty of being a woman in Turkey? Does our literature have to be political in order to be considered “Turkish”? In my latest novel, At the Breakfast Table, a family gathering to celebrate the matriarch’s 100th birthday soon exposes the family’s – and Turkey’s – fraught history. In this way, I see my writing as Turkish – these are the issues that we breathe every day; they are buried in the soil under our feet. Yet there is also a balance: the greatest Turkish literature discusses serious issues, but will also lighten the heart and put a smile on your face. With the choices below, I wanted to highlight books about Turkey that not only talk about its historical and social context, but also reflect the distinctive styles and the creativity of their authors in dealing with individual, philosophical and political questions. In the Shadow of the Yali by Suat DervisOriginally published in 1945, this is the Madame Bovary of Turkish literature. One of Turkey’s leading female authors, Dervis (1905–72) wrote about the loss and longing of urban, affluent Turkish women. In this novel, Celile is torn between her respectable husband and her passionate tango partner in 1940s Istanbul. Although the story is, in many ways, universal, Dervis brilliantly captures the particularities of Turkish society and its struggle with modernity. Set in 1970s Istanbul, it follows 30-year-old Kemal, the son of an educated urban family, who falls in love with a distant relative – the beautiful 18-year-old Füsun – who comes from a family of modest means. Pamuk has also built a real Museum of Innocence: if you are visiting Istanbul, you can go to Füsun’s house and see “her” shoes and dresses, cinema tickets, and the hundreds of cigarette butts that the heartbroken Kemal collected. It is at once funny and tragic, a modern Istanbul story that takes place in 10 flats which sit within the once-glorious, now dilapidated Bonbon Palace. A story within a story which is told from the different perspectives of the building’s residents, The Flea Palace paints a brilliant picture of Turkey on the brink of the 21st century, and is written with intelligence and love.","Top 10sTop 10 novels about Turkey I am often asked what defines Turkish literature.

Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has slammed the European Commission’s annual report assessing its long-stalled bid to join the European Union, saying it was unjust and biased. The report, published on Wednesday by the EU’s executive arm, accused Ankara of “serious backsliding” on democratic standards, the rule of law, human rights and judicial independence. “We categorically reject unfounded claims and unjust criticisms, particularly on the political criteria and the Chapter on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The Commission also said Turkey did not comply with the principles of the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in its counterterrorism operations. The Turkish ministry said the allegations were unfair and highlighted “the insincerity of EU’s approach and a clear double-standard”, adding that fundamental rights issues were contentious even among EU member states. The Commission’s report is meant to update Turkey’s progress towards meeting standards for EU membership and could strain ties that are already troubled over immigration and, more recently, the war between Israel and the Hamas armed group in Gaza. Since Israel started bombarding the Gaza Strip on October 7, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of “behaving like a war criminal” and blamed the West for being the “main culprit behind the massacre unfolding”. Turkey began talks to join the EU in 2005, but that bid has long been frozen due to rights concerns and foreign policy rifts. The EU has grown frustrated by Turkey’s stance on issues such as Syria, Cyprus, and Libya as well as its competing territorial claims with Greece to islands in the Aegean Sea. On September 13, the European Parliament adopted a report by the European Commission stating Turkey’s EU accession process “cannot be resumed” without a “drastic change of course” by Ankara. Erdogan responded that Ankara could “part ways with the EU” if necessary.","Ankara slams EU report on Turkey’s membership bid as unjust and biased The report on Turkey’s progress towards meeting standards for EU membership says Ankara is ‘backsliding’.

Six people died and 81 were injured when a bomb struck Istanbul’s popular pedestrian thoroughfare İstiklal Avenue, timed to strike when it was most crowded. Turkey’s justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said that “a woman sat on a bench there for 45 minutes”, and that the explosion occurred moments after she left. The Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said early on Monday the attack was planned in a Kurdish-majority city in northern Syria, blaming militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and the People’s Defence Units (YPG). While Kurdish militants and attackers linked to Islamic State (IS) have been blamed for attacks on central Istanbul in the past, the attack has not been officially claimed by any group so far. Ankara, Washington and the EU label the PKK a terrorist group, stemming from its decades-long insurgency demanding Kurdish self-rule in south-eastern Turkey. Istanbul police said that 46 people had been detained in total. The Turkish presidential communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, alluded to the potential impact on US-Turkey relations, stemming from Ankara’s long-term displeasure with the US backing of Kurdish groups in northern Syria. Soylu added that Turkey “will not accept messages of condolence” from the US concerning the attack. The PKK is also regularly targeted by Turkish military operations in northern Iraq, while Ankara has also blocked Swedish entry into Nato after accusing it of leniency towards the group. Turkey’s media ombudsman, RTÜK, placed a temporary ban on reporting of the explosion, preventing broadcasters from showing the moment the blast struck or the immediate aftermath, “to avoid broadcasts that may create fear, panic and turmoil in society and may serve the purposes of terrorist organisations”. The web freedom monitoring organisation NetBlocks said network data showed the Turkish authorities were restricting access to social media platforms including Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook after the attack.","Istanbul bombing: 46 detained as Turkey minister blames Kurdish separatists Six people died and 81 were injured when Istanbul’s popular pedestrian thoroughfare İstiklal Avenue was hit by a bomb attack Turkey’s interior minister has accused Kurdish militants in northern Syria of responsibility for a bombing in a busy Istanbul shopping thoroughfare that killed six people, and said that a suspect had been arrested.

For so long now, the opposition in Turkey has been demoralised, fractured and weak against an unbridled concentration of power and authority.

About 61 million Turkish citizens voted across 81 cities. Turkey’s official figure for inflation is just under 70%. The devaluation of the Turkish lira has hit businesses of all sizes and harmed living standards. As opposed to an inward-looking, navel-gazing, ultra-nationalist, ultra-religious, increasingly authoritarian and illiberal Turkey, the dream of a secular, democratic, pluralistic, inclusive and modern Turkey is still very much alive. The man at the heart of this dream is none other than Istanbul’s charismatic mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu.

President Erdoğan – a former mayor of the city – once said: “Whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey.” Before the local elections, Erdoğan led prayers at the Hagia Sophia – reviving an old tradition practised by Ottoman sultans before they would wage a war. It is against this backdrop that the incumbent mayor of Istanbul, İmamoğlu – Erdogan’s most significant rival – achieved the highest margin of victory in 40 years. In a moving post-election speech, İmamoğlu said to the celebrating crowds: “Starting from tomorrow, Turkey will be a different Turkey. Istanbul stands as a beacon of hope, a testament to the resilience of democratic values in the face of rising authoritarianism.” In the capital, Ankara, the CHP mayor, Mansur Yavaş, also did remarkably well, gaining 60.4% of the vote.","Women have found their voice in Turkey, and given hope to others fighting for democracy across the globe Turkey is a beautiful and complicated country that never ceases to bewilder not only international observers but also, at times, its own citizens.

The most obvious issue is the economy, a problem that the Turkish government has faced for a number of years, and that remains the biggest millstone around its neck, leading to widespread frustration, discontent, and grievances. Increased income inequality, runaway inflation, a rapid depreciation of the national currency, soaring costs, and a decline in the standard of living for pensioners are just some of the economic problems the Turkish people are living through, leading to widespread frustration, discontent, and grievances.

As European nations opposed to the invasion of Ukraine have moved to reduce their dependence on Russian oil and gas, enduring soaring price increases and possible shortages, Turkey has deepened its energy ties to Russia. Since the war started, Turkey’s imports of Russian crude oil and coal have climbed sharply. The presidents of both countries have talked about how to turn Turkey into a regional trading center for Russian gas. And Turkey has suggested building a second nuclear power plant designed and financed by Russia in addition to the one already scheduled to come online next year. Cheaper energy is helping to keep Turkey’s sinking economy afloat at a critical time. But the maneuvers are also part of an attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to use the energy crisis to advance a longstanding dream of the Turks to become a major energy hub. Its location between Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East puts Turkey in a pivotal spot. Turkey’s growing role in the world’s energy trade was on notable display this week as the European Union’s embargo of seaborne Russian crude went into effect along with the imposition of an American-led price cap on Russian oil. More than 20 oil tankers, most with no ties to Russia, sat in Turkish waters, waiting for permission to make their way through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits into the Mediterranean Sea. Turkey has demanded additional proof of insurance, saying the price cap has increased the risk of uninsured tankers off its coast. On Friday a Russian delegation reportedly visited Ankara to discuss Turkey’s request for a 25 percent discount on natural gas. At the same time, maritime tracking logs showed large cargo ships filled with Russian coal or oil headed toward Turkish ports.

Tensions have been growing between the Mediterranean neighbours after Mr Mitsotakis urged a joint session of the US Congress not to drop a ban on Turkey's membership of a purchasing programme for the next generation F-35 fighter jet last week. The Biden administration has reportedly been considering dropping the ban, imposed after Ankara purchased an S-400 air defence system from Russia in 2019.

But Erdogan’s failure to top the 50-percent threshold set up Turkey’s first run-off on Sunday and underscored the gradual ebbing of his support. Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Ankara, said Erdogan’s message has not changed significantly from the first round of the election. “He was making a promise to make the next century the century of Turkey. He was promising a more powerful and assertive Turkey in the international arena,” he said.

Erdogan forced the central bank to follow through on his unconventional theory that lower interest rates bring down inflation, but Turkey’s annual inflation rate touched 85 percent last year while the lira entered a brief freefall.","Erdogan, Kilicdaroglu in last push to rally voters before run-off Erdogan paid homage to his conservative predecessor with a visit to Istanbul’s Adnan Menderes mausoleum on Saturday, to rally his conservative base.

Turkey proved instrumental in mediating a recent, hard-won deal enabling Ukraine to resume its grain exports this week for the first time since Russia invaded in late February. The two also agreed to continue cooperating on energy, which Russia supplies in volume to Turkey. Mr. Putin praised the TurkStream pipeline as a main conduit for Russian gas that is still flowing to Europe. Russian officials said that Turkey had also agreed to settle some of its substantial annual energy bill in rubles — something many Western countries have refused to do because it would blunt their stiff sanctions, some of which are aimed at weakening Russia’s currency.

But it did not resolve some of the friction points between them, including security in the Middle East, or the possibility of Mr. Putin using relations with Turkey to try to find or create chinks in Western unity against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.","Putin and Erdogan find more room to cooperate at a meeting in Sochi, Russia.

He pointed in a Facebook post to Turkey's ""strict interpretation of the protocol rules... But when the three leaders came to sit down, there were just two chairs, one with a Turkish flag behind it, the other with an EU flag. Mrs von der Leyen eventually sits down on a sofa, well away from the Turkish leader and opposite the Turkish foreign minister. When the Turkish leader visited Brussels in 2017, the two men heading the European Commission and Council sat beside him in comfy armchairs. Video of the Commission president's discomfort went viral, with criticism of both the Turkish hosts and Mr Michel's decision to sit down while his colleague remained standing. Dutch Euro MP Sophie in 't Veld complained it was a deliberate slight by the Turks that ""puts into question the equal treatment"" of Mrs von der Leyen, and that it was not a coincidence she was the only woman in the room. It did not go unnoticed that Turkey's recent decision to pull out of the Istanbul convention on violence against women was on the agenda for Tuesday's talks. Iratxe García Pérez, leader of the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, said it was ""shameful"", with Turkey first leaving the Istanbul convention, then leaving the Commission president without a seat. Ties between Turkey and the EU have been strained for years, over the influx of migrants and recently over Turkey's drive for gas in the Eastern Mediterranean. After the meeting, Mrs von der Leyen held out hope of revising a 2016 deal under which the EU pays Turkey to prevent large-scale arrivals in Greece.",NEGATIVE,0.9966942071914672,"Türkiye, AB'yi 'sofagate' diplomatik tartışmasında suçluyor","Gergin AB-Türkiye ilişkilerini düzeltmeye yönelik bir girişim olarak başlayan şey, ""sofagate"" olarak adlandırılan bir diplomatik kavgaya dönüştü.

The move has been broadly seen as a political offering ahead of a mooted visit by Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Saudi Arabia in search of renewed trade and investment to boost Ankara’s ailing economy. The prosecutor leading the case asked an Istanbul court on Thursday for the cases of the 26 suspects to be handed over to Riyadh and claimed there was little point in pursuing a trial in absentia. In the years since, Turkey had mostly maintained a hardline stance against Riyadh and demanded justice for Khashoggi as well as unspecified repatriations.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68945380,Turkey halts trade with Israel over Gaza 'tragedy',3 May 2024,"Turkey has suspended all trade with Israel over its offensive in Gaza, citing the ""worsening humanitarian tragedy"" in the strip. The Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an ""uninterrupted and sufficient flow"" of aid into Gaza. Israel's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator"". Israel Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was ""disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements"". He added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries. The ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's ""uncompromising attitude"" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: ""Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption."" In 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. In 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.

The Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an ""uninterrupted and sufficient flow"" of aid into Gaza. Israel's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator"". Israel Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was ""disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements"". He added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries. The ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's ""uncompromising attitude"" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: ""Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption."" In 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. In 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip.

With more than 95 percent of ballot boxes opened in Istanbul on Sunday, Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) said he had defeated the governing AK Party candidate by more than one million votes. “Tonight, 16 million Istanbul citizens sent a message to both our rivals and the president.” In the capital, Ankara, CHP’s Mayor Mansur Yavas claimed victory over his rival, hailing the result as a “clear message to those who rule this country”.

Arriving in Turkey in late 2020, shortly before a ban on mixed plastic waste imports came into force, the containers quickly became the centre of a battle between traders, a shipping line, multiple governments and environmental campaigners demanding their return. Turkish authorities refused entry to the containers, leaving them in limbo. But then we found out their import licence was cancelled, and they were blacklisted by Turkey. Lab tests showed some loads in the containers are hazardous city waste,” said Omer Bulduk of Monax, a Turkish freight company assigned to receive the containers. In May, the Turkish foreign ministry contacted their counterparts in Germany to demand the containers’ return. Angela Griesbach, a spokesperson for the waste management authority in the state of Baden-Württemberg, now in charge of overseeing the containers, said this was “probably a misunderstanding”, adding that the containers contained waste that was legal when it arrived in Turkey. “There’s also almost a hundred containers sitting in Turkey, and we’re very worried they will be bound for countries like Vietnam,” he added. If certain conditions were met, she added, the containers in Turkey could be returned. “If the problem is not an internal Turkish enforcement problem, the German authorities, as well as the German company voluntarily, are willing to take back this waste in accordance with the law. However, this requires the corresponding cooperation and information from the Turkish side.” The Turkish environment ministry did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue. Vietnam and Turkey are two of a growing number of countries that have reported a sudden spike in plastic waste, after China’s decision to ban waste imports in 2018 proved to be a watershed for the global trade. Matthew Gordon, an environmental researcher at Yale University who is part of a team compiling an “atlas of plastic waste” to show new plastic dumping sites across the world, said he was surprised by the number of countries represented in their initial findings, including Bosnia, Thailand, Romania, Malaysia and Turkey.","‘Waste colonialism’: world grapples with west’s unwanted plastic Germany and UK are big exporters of plastic, much of which lies rotting in ports in Turkey, Vietnam and other countries Scattered between Turkey, Greece and Vietnam, far from their origins in Germany, the containers’ voyage sheds light on the hidden global trade in plastic waste.

Çavuşoğlu said the decision would allow Turkey – which is mostly Muslim, but officially secular – to lobby for Palestinian interests in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem. Like most UN members, Turkey does not recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and its embassy is located in Tel Aviv.

Turkey’s parliament has approved Sweden’s NATO membership bid after more than four hours of debates. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days, ending the 20-month-long delay that has frustrated some of Ankara’s Western allies. “Positive that the Grand General Assembly of Turkiye has voted in favour of Sweden’s NATO accession,” he wrote on social media platform X. Turkey’s ratification leaves Hungary as the last holdout in an accession process that Sweden and its neighbour Finland began in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago. Ankara has profited from maintaining – and even expanding – trade with Russia while at the same time supplying Ukraine with drones and other essential arms. Turkish media reported that Putin could make his first wartime visit to Turkey next month. Erdogan’s objections to Sweden’s bid initially focused on Stockholm’s perceived acceptance of Kurdish groups that Ankara views as “terrorists”. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax Turkey’s arms export policies. The Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee approved the Swedish bid last month after Erdogan forwarded it to parliament in October. However, Erdogan has since demanded that the US follow through on its pledge to deliver a batch of F-16 fighter jets for Turkey’s ageing air force. US officials argued that Turkey’s request could win the required congressional approval if Sweden’s NATO accession goes through – a position reaffirmed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a visit to Istanbul this month. “We have not parsed words about how ready we are for Sweden to formally join the alliance,” said US Department of State deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel after news emerged that Turkey was finally ready to ratify the Swedish candidacy.","Turkey’s parliament approves Sweden’s NATO bid Turkey endorsed Finland’s membership bid in April but, along with Hungary, kept Sweden waiting.

Istanbul, Turkey – The war on Gaza has seen Turkey step forward as a potential mediator to not only end Israel’s bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, but also bring lasting peace to one of the world’s most intractable conflicts. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led his country’s bid, keen to promote Turkey as a global player and replicate Ankara’s success in mediating between Ukraine and its invader, Russia, to strike a deal for Kyiv to export grain. Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory air raids on Gaza – which have yet to end – came as Ankara and Tel Aviv were fostering warmer ties after more than a decade of hostility. Turkey has relations with Hamas, making it one of the few countries with any influence with the group that has ruled Gaza since 2007. Ankara did not declare Hamas a “terrorist organisation”, leading Tel Aviv to protest that Turkey-based Hamas members have been involved in planning attacks on Israel. “Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas, which is an important asset,” Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, said. “It has been built up over 17 years, when Turkey was the only country to invite Hamas into [its capital]. “In these times of crisis, the communication channels and relations are important,” said Ozhan, a former chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee. Turkish officials – led by Erdogan and his foreign minister, Hakan Fidan – have acted on this advantage, seeing a central role for Ankara in resolving the latest Gaza conflict. Speaking in Beirut on Tuesday, Fidan said “a variety of countries” had asked Turkey for help in releasing their citizens. There is wide public support in Turkey for the Palestinian cause, with pro-Palestine demonstrations drawing thousands of Turks in recent days. At the same time, Turkey had relations with Israel for much of Israel’s history, until things hit a rough patch in 2010. That year, Israel killed nine Turks who were on board a Freedom Flotilla trying to deliver humanitarian aid to a besieged Gaza Strip, with a tenth dying after years in a coma.","Is Turkey uniquely positioned to mediate between Palestinians and Israel?

Istanbul, Turkey – Istanbul’s skyline has been rapidly transforming over the years as towering new skyscrapers pop up and expansive bridges connect the metropolis that spans two continents. Since 2019, Grand Camlica Mosque – which stretches over 57,500sq metres (620,000sq feet) and has six minarets and a towering central dome – has been the most visible structure on the Anatolian side of Turkey’s cultural capital. Perched on the hill after which it is named, the now-largest mosque in Turkey opened its doors to the public on March 7, 2019, as a place of worship as well as a symbol of state pride and Turkish national identity. Since the establishment of the modern republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, Turkish nationalism has been largely defined by secular symbols that lean away from religion and the country’s Ottoman past. As president of the early republic, Ataturk outlawed the fez and turban – two forms of Ottoman male headgear – and later the headscarf was banned in state institutions. He also transformed the Turkish language from Arabic to Latin script, moved the capital city from the Ottoman epicentre of Constantinople – later known as Istanbul – to a newly established Ankara, and replaced religious courts with a European-inspired legal system. Although the “headscarf ban” was notably overturned by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which came to power 20 years ago, religious symbols have remained distinct from the secular Turkish state. Yet, Camlica Mosque reflects how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attempted to challenge the secular narrative of Turkish nationalism by attempting to connect state pride to an Ottoman past and an Islamic heritage. “The main objective of the 1923 Turkish revolution was to create a new nation and national identity by fighting the old one,” said Turkish sociologist Ferhat Kentel. Hayriye Gul, one of the two female architects behind the design of the complex, told Al Jazeera that the structure aimed to contribute to the silhouette of Istanbul in a modern and practical way while reflecting traditional Turco-Islamic architecture. “As Turkish citizens and architects, we’re proud to be part of building such a monumental mosque during the republican era,” said Mizrak.","Turkey’s Camlica Mosque: Ottoman heritage or modern nationalism?

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68704375,Turkish opposition stuns Erdogan with local elections win,1 Apr 2024,"Turkey's main opposition party has claimed big election victories in the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara. He led the campaign to win in Istanbul, where he grew up and became mayor. Mr Erdogan had vowed a new era in Turkey's megacity of almost 16 million people, but the incumbent mayor of Istanbul secured more than 50% of the vote, defeating the president's AK Party candidate by more than 11 points and almost one million votes. In the capital Ankara, opposition mayor Mansur Yavas was so far ahead of his rival on 60% that he declared victory when fewer than half the votes were in. Significantly it also gained control of Turkey's fourth-biggest city Bursa and Balikesir in the north-west, as well as Adiyaman, which hit hard by last year's double earthquake in the south-east. President Erdogan, 70, acknowledged the election had not gone as he had hoped, but he told supporters in Ankara it would mark ""not an end for us but rather a turning point"". Under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's presidency has amassed sweeping powers, replacing the prime minister. The outcome was a big success for the chairman of the CHP, Ozgur Ozel, who praised voters for deciding to change the face of Turkey in a historic vote: ""They want to open the door to a new political climate in our country."" Crowds in Istanbul gathered outside the town hall in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts. They waved Turkish flags and banners showing Ekrem Imamoglu's picture alongside Turkey's founding father Kemal Ataturk, whose poster was draped down the walls of the local authority building. ""Everything will be fine,"" Imamoglu supporters chanted as they danced to drums and clarinets in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts. Istanbul's incumbent mayor had first used the slogan when he won the city from Mr Erdogan's party five years ago. Mehmet Bankaci, 27, told the BBC there was a need for change in Turkey: ""If Imamoglu or Mansur Yavas had been the CHP candidate in last year's presidential election, they definitely would have won.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16352745,Q&A: Armenian genocide dispute,24 Apr 2021,"The mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One remains a highly sensitive issue. Turkey has resisted widespread calls for it to recognise the 1915-16 killings as genocide, while historians continue to argue about the events. At the time there were numerous reports of Turkish atrocities committed against the Armenians. There is general agreement that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died when the Ottoman Turks deported them en masse from eastern Anatolia and across the Ottoman empire to the Syrian desert and elsewhere in 1915-16. The Republic of Turkey estimates the total to be 300,000. In a 2005 letter to Turkey's then prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the IAGS said: ""We want to underscore that it is not just Armenians who are affirming the Armenian Genocide but it is the overwhelming opinion of scholars who study genocide."" Turkish officials accept that atrocities were committed but argue that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people. Turkey says many Muslim Turks also died in the turmoil of war. The Young Turks - an officers' movement that had seized power in 1908 - launched a series of measures against Armenians as the Ottoman Empire was crumbling through military defeats in the war. The Young Turks - calling themselves the Committee of Unity and Progress (CUP) - had entered the war on Germany's side in 1914. Turkish propaganda at the time presented the Armenians as saboteurs and a pro-Russian ""fifth column"". Several senior Ottoman officials were put on trial in Turkey in 1919-20 in connection with the atrocities. The Young Turks' top triumvirate - the ""Three Pashas"" - had already fled abroad. Historians have questioned the judicial procedures at these trials, the quality of the evidence presented and the degree to which the Turkish authorities may have wished to appease the victorious Allies. US governments had held back for decades, partly because Turkey is the second-biggest military power in Nato and strategically vital for the West. Turkey reacted angrily after Pope Francis called it ""the first genocide of the 20th Century"" in the run-up to the centenary commemorations. Turkey recalled its Vatican ambassador and accused the Pope of having ""discriminated about people's suffering"".","Q&A: Armenian genocide dispute The mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One remains a highly sensitive issue.

Turks have finished voting in one of the most consequential elections in the country’s 100-year history, a contest that could end President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s 20-year rule and reverberate well beyond Turkey’s borders. A heavy turnout means that there have been long lines at polling stations across Turkey, particularly in its biggest cities. The Istanbul Bar Association has reminded people that if they are already waiting at a polling station before 5pm they will be able to stay and vote, but anyone joining the queue after will not be allowed to vote. Turkish law bans the reporting of any results until 9pm (18:00 GMT), although that has been brought forward in the past. The presidential vote will decide not only who leads Turkey, a NATO-member country of 85 million, but also how it is governed, where its economy is headed amid a deep cost-of-living crisis, and the shape of its foreign policy. Turkey has grown into a military and geopolitical heavyweight that plays roles in conflicts from Syria to Ukraine. So Turkey may enter a post-Erdogan era after Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, and that could mean foreign policy changes. Erdogan is still lionised across swathes of Turkey that witnessed a development boom during his rule. The emergence of Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his six-party alliance – a group that forms the type of broad-based coalition that Erdogan excelled at forging throughout his career – gives foreign allies and Turkish voters a clear alternative. But he would still be hounded by Turkey’s most dire economic crisis of his time in power and disquiet over his government’s stuttering response to February earthquakes that claimed more than 50,000 lives.","Polling stations in Turkey close after momentous election Voter turnout has been high for an election that could define Turkey’s future.

The Pentagon says United States warplanes have shot down a Turkish drone, which was deemed a threat to its forces in Syria, in an incident that might raise tensions between the NATO allies. The development came on Thursday as Turkey targeted Kurdish forces in Syria following a suicide bombing in Ankara that was claimed by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). A few hours later, a Turkish drone returned to the ROZ and flew towards American forces despite what a US official said were a dozen calls to Ankara’s military. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Turkish counterpart Yasar Guler on Thursday, urging “de-escalation in northern Syria and the importance of maintaining strict adherence to de-confliction protocols and communication through established military-to-military channels,” Ryder said in a statement. Turkey’s defence ministry confirmed the call, saying the two officials discussed “the latest developments in Syria”. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said the UAV did not belong to the Turkish military, according to a statement. “It is not only the Turkish military that conducts counterterrorism operations in northern Iraq and Syria,” she said. She said that the Turkish intelligence and interior ministry’s gendarmerie also joined operations.

Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said Turkish officials say operations are carried out as part of the country’s right to self-defence. “Turkey has warned other countries to stay away from areas controlled by groups it will continue to target,” he said. On Friday, Turkey’s military conducted another round of air strikes in northern Syria and destroyed 15 other targets where it said PKK-affiliate fighters were believed to be, according to the defence ministry. However, Turkey views the Kurdish People’s Protection Units that dominate the SDF as an offshoot of the PKK, which is considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara and its Western allies.","US shoots down Turkish drone over Syria after attacks near Hasakah The incident comes as Turkey intensifies its military operation in northern Syria after a suicide bombing in Ankara.

But looking at Turkish politics today, there is one ideology that is represented across the board: nationalism. Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate. It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year. Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right. Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s. Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence. While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right. But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean. It all means that while Erdogan’s roots in political Islam can never be discounted and continue to be attractive to domestic conservatives, Turkish nationalism is arguably the stronger ideology within the Turkish government and will continue to be going forward.","In Turkey’s elections, nationalism is the real winner External analysis of Turkish politics often tends to focus on the divide between political Islamism and secularism, between liberals and conservatives.

Despite restoration led by the opposition-controlled Istanbul municipality, local news stories about sections of the wall collapsing are a frequent occurrence, a sign of how the city’s pre-Ottoman heritage often hides in plain sight, is allowed to wither or is obscured for political purposes. Local architects and historians grumbled when a Byzantine palace was restored – under a former Istanbul mayor loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – to emphasise its Ottoman features, and is now a museum displaying Ottoman-era crafts. Large sections of the Byzantine walls, as well as other ancient remains, dot an area of Istanbul known as its historical peninsula, now the conservative municipality of Fatih. Today, the walls symbolise a turning point in the city’s history and that of the wider region: the conquest of Istanbul by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, marking the end of the Byzantine empire. Constantinople became the capital of the Ottoman empire, renamed Istanbul, and many churches and cathedrals, including the famed Hagia Sophia, were converted into mosques. The government in Ankara has long sought to harness this symbolism. Alexander Christie-Miller, the author of the forthcoming To the City: Life and Death Along the Ancient Walls of Istanbul, pointed to a museum dedicated to the Ottoman conquest that lies close to the crumbling walls, while the site of the conquest itself has long been overlooked. “It’s ironic that there’s a completely artificial recreation of the siege, but 200 metres away from the actual scene where it happened is in a state of massive neglect – there’s obviously an element of this connected to a longstanding strain in republican Turkish history whereby the pre-Ottoman heritage is neglected,” he said. This neglect, combined with the ability to hide from public view between the double walls which run along some underserved neighbourhoods of Istanbul, has led to pockets being heavily associated with crime. It’s really a function of their size, and that Istanbul as a city has never had the capacity to really restore them,” said Christie-Miller.","‘People come to touch the walls’: fears for Istanbul’s crumbling Byzantine past Turkish city’s pre-Ottoman heritage is falling away through lack of care or being obscured for political purposes Inside a municipal cafe built into Istanbul’s ancient city walls, waiters scurried back and forth carrying cups of strong Turkish tea and hefty slices of chocolate cake.

All to know about Turkey election results,15 May 2023,"So, who won Turkey’s presidential election? After a highly-contested first round of elections on Sunday, Turkey is very likely heading towards a run-off vote on May 28 as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was hoping to secure a third term, has barely failed to secure the required 50 percent of votes, despite faring better than predicted. He and his closest competitor, Kemal Kilicdarolgu, will likely gear up to campaign over the next two weeks as Erdogan tries to extend his two-decade rule, and Kilicdaroglu hopes to launch Turkey on a “new path” with the backing of his six-party alliance. The final results from Sunday’s vote are expected to be announced by 3pm (12:00 GMT) on Monday, Al Jazeera’s Farah al-Zaman Shawki said from Ankara, with votes from abroad yet to be fully counted. With 99 percent of domestic ballot boxes counted, Erdogan had 49.92 percent of votes, with Kilicdaroglu trailing closely with 44.95 percent of votes, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency, which gets its numbers from Turkey’s Supreme Election Council. This would be the first run-off vote under Turkey’s new electoral system. Turkey transitioned from a parliamentary system to a presidential one in July 2018. The 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2007 presidential elections went to a third round, but both the voting and political systems were different from the ones in place in Turkey now.

Translation: No, Der Spiegel, in the interview I gave you, we didn’t say anything different from the general conditions we said to the Turkish press. Carkoglu said what went wrong for the opposition was that “they couldn’t get any support from the heartland of Turkey”. “They are also questioning the alliance with the pro-Kurdish HDP which the Turkish government considers to be a political wing of the PKK,” she said.","What’s a run-off?

Sweden's bid to join Nato has been delayed principally by Turkey's demand that it extradites dozens of people it views as terrorists. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet the Swedish prime minister in Lithuania on Monday ahead of a Nato summit, where Sweden is hoping to be welcomed into the Western defensive alliance. Last month prosecutor Hans Ihrman stressed that the timing of the case was ""pure coincidence"", even though Turkey had urged Sweden to use terror laws to target Kurds suspected of having links to PKK militants. But the timing was not lost on commentators who pointed out that it sent a message to Ankara that Sweden was getting tough on the PKK, which launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state in 1984. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the case was an example of how organised crime in Sweden was linked to terrorist organisations in Turkey. The 41-year-old Kurdish man who was jailed on Thursday has Turkish origins and the judge said he would be deported as soon as he had served his sentence. Last month the government also announced it would extradite a Turkish Kurd who was legally resident in Sweden. Turkey said it was because of a drug crime but the man argued he was being pursued because of his support for Turkey's biggest pro-Kurdish political party. Thursday's jail sentence coincided with a key meeting in Brussels involving the foreign ministers of Sweden, Turkey and Finland, ahead of next week's Nato summit in Vilnius. Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Swedish radio she was hoping for a quick announcement on Nato membership, even though Turkey had made no promises. Finland and Sweden decided to join Nato in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Finland officially became a member in April after Turkey eventually withdraw its initial objections. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly highlighted problems with Sweden's bid, saying even this week that it needed to do more on its ""homework"". Hungary has also stalled on backing the Swedish bid, but says if Turkey shifts its stance it will not delay the process.","Sweden jails Kurd for financing terrorism Turkey has long called on Stockholm to crack down on Kurdish separatists.

Istanbul, Turkey – The news that Fethullah Gulen, widely believed in Turkey to be the mastermind behind the country’s 2016 coup attempt, had died had not yet reached Omer, a taxi driver heading towards Istanbul’s Fatih district. As word of Gulen’s death in the United States spread on a crisp autumn day, bystanders began gathering outside the Istanbul municipality building in Fatih – one of the epicentres of the violence during the coup attempt, a night widely regarded as a turning point in modern Turkish history. The memorial includes a depiction of protesters performing ablution – a ritual purification for Muslims – at a nearby fountain before confronting soldiers and tanks in response to a call by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His followers in the armed forces were believed by the state to be behind the coup – a point of view widely shared in Turkey by government supporters and the opposition. Gulen went from being a preacher in western Turkey to the founder of an expansive movement that ran schools, charities and media organisations. Not far from the Fatih municipality headquarters, at Eski Kafa, one of the district’s many small coffee shops, several young men enjoying their afternoon Turkish coffee were already discussing Gulen’s death. “The second reason I’m satisfied is that his death might lead to some normalisation in Turkey regarding political issues. It changed the way Turkey operates.” The attempted coup left a deep mark on Fatih, Istanbul’s historic district, where most have a story about where they were that night. A memorial for all those killed stands at the centre of Fatih with photos of the dead, a marker for many of the first Turkish coup that ordinary citizens were able to prevent. “After the coup attempt, I went to Vatan Street, in front of the Istanbul police headquarters. Ahmet Faruk Yilmaz, a 29-year-old artist sipping his Turkish tea, hopes Gulen’s death will mark the collapse of his organisation.","In Turkey, Gulen’s death marks opportunity to move on from coup attempt Fethullah Gulen, who has died aged 83, was blamed by Turkey for being behind a 2016 coup attempt.

Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. Ankara has accused both Finland and Sweden of hosting Kurdish militants. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"".

He called on Finland to hand over six members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and another six from the movement of exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkey also wants 11 PKK members and 10 Gulenists to be extradited from Sweden. The PKK, formed in the late 1970s, launched an armed struggle against the Turkish government in 1984, calling for an independent Kurdish state within Turkey. Meanwhile, the Gulenists are blamed by Turkey for a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. Finland and Sweden have so far made no public comments on the Turkish request. They also promised not to support the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its military wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG) - which Ankara insists is an extension of the PKK. The two countries also pledged to lift their restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey. Magdalena Andersson looked visibly happy in the Madrid sunshine as she told Swedish Television's morning show that she'd slept well after the ""big day"" that saw Turkey finally sanctioning a Nato spot for Sweden and Finland. She's become something of a global political celebrity in recent weeks, appearing on international TV channels to argue Sweden shouldn't make concessions to Turkey, which she's described as an Islamist dictatorship. But the Nato agreement indicates this won't be the case, since Turkey considers the group's political arm to be a cover for the militant PKK.","Turkey pushes for extraditions after Nato deal Turkey says it will now be pushing for the extradition of 33 ""terror"" suspects from Finland and Sweden, under a deal that lifted Ankara's objections to the two Nordic states' bids to join Nato.

It came a day after an unprecedented statement from a Turkish nationalist leader about the possibility of a renewed peace process with the country’s outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The group – considered a “terrorist” group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union – has been fighting a 40-year-long rebellion against the Turkish state. Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed the attack in a post on X. “A terrorist attack was carried out against the Turkish Aerospace Industries Ankara Kahramankazan facilities,” he wrote. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Ankara, said a blast took place next to a security booth and may have injured security personnel. Kahramankazan an area to the north of Turkey’s capital, Ankara. Yerlikaya, the Turkish interior minister, confirmed that one of the assailants was a woman. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday night, Turkish National Defence Minister Yasar Guler alleged the PKK had carried out the attack.

The number of attacks in major Turkish cities has dropped sharply since 2017. “This is more of a message that the Turkish defence industry can be targeted and harmed”, said Omer Ozkizilcik, non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs. “Turkish drones are a major game changer in the Turkish counterterrorism effort.

In August 2019, after inspecting the cockpit of Russia’s then-new fifth-generation Su-57 fighter warplane, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, if it was for sale. The exchange exemplified the renewed closeness of Turkish-Russian security relations after a difficult period, during which Turkey downed a Russian fighter plane that it said had strayed across the border from Syria. As Turkey has sought to position itself as a regional heavyweight, the Justice and Development Party or AK Party leader’s confident, if confrontational, style has shaped the country’s international relations. Turkey has certainly grown more influential – not just across the Middle East, but also Africa and Europe, with its prominent role in mediating between Russia and Ukraine a particular example. So, Turkey may enter a post-Erdogan era after Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, and that could mean foreign policy changes. “The style of foreign policymaking will change and that’s more important than issue-based changes because currently foreign policy is conducted entirely [in] a personalised manner,” Salim Cevik, a researcher at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik’s Center for Applied Turkey Studies in Berlin, Germany, told Al Jazeera. “Turkey will be much more predictable because it will be more institutionalised,” the researcher said. Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East, said that Erdogan’s policies are also aimed at increasing Turkey’s soft power, particularly in the Muslim world, a continuation of the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled vast swaths of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans for centuries. “Erdogan’s assertive nature has irked the major powers who are more accustomed to Turkey’s historical role as a supporting actor,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera. “At the same time, Turkey’s rapidly expanding influence is rooted in Erdogan’s ability to capitalise on Islamic soft power via his ‘Muslim’ rhetoric, enabling him to advance rapidly both politically and economically into [multiple regions],” he added.","Turkey’s foreign policy: From past to potential post-Erdogan era Erdogan’s independent foreign policy put Turkey on the map – the opposition’s may be far more muted.

Turkey’s government regards members of the Gülen movement as a terrorist group responsible for plotting the failed 2016 coup and has criticised Interpol for hindering its prosecution efforts.

Interpol’s interventions against Turkey are among a number of publicly known examples of the organisation’s efforts to stop politically motivated notices in recent years.

Seven months later, after he reported to Kenyan police in May as part of his bail requirements, Gülen was detained again and deported to Turkey. An expert witness argued that after the 2016 attempted coup Turkey had reopened charges that had been dropped in 2008. But it was too late for Gülen: he was already in Turkish custody and now faces multiple charges including for terrorism offences, according to local media.

Athens, Greece – Greece’s migration minister has welcomed the Turkish government’s willingness to reduce migration flows from Asia into Europe, during an interview with Al Jazeera.

Kairidis, whose government took office in July, visited his Turkish counterpart, Ali Yerlikaya, on October 19. “I was presented with a lot of data from the Turkish side,” Kairidis said. Turkish authorities said they had arrested 140,000 undocumented people attempting to cross into Europe since the beginning of the year. And Turkey said it had arrested 5,000 smugglers. “These are all very positive, and we see especially on the land border with Greece and Bulgaria a very determined action on the part of Turkey’s security forces, army police and gendarmerie, to do away with smugglers and flows,” Kairidis said. “Turkey does not want to be an international hub of illegal migration,” said Kairidis, because Turkey was already hosting an estimated 4.7 million refugees, and trafficking “stimulates increased flows into Turkey at a time of great fluidity”. But Kairidis believed Turkey’s about-turn was also due to the fact that “the previous policy did not work”. Arrivals on the Greek islands from the Turkish coast had shot up over the summer. Not everyone agreed that these increases were due to Turkish smugglers stepping up their business or Turkish authorities dropping their vigilance. “We have the oldest Muslim community in Europe,” he said, referring to a 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, which left intact the Muslims of Thrace and the Greek Christians of Istanbul.","Greek minister hails Turkish u-turn in migration policy A new era of cooperation benefits Turkey, Greece and the European Union at a time of upheaval, says Migration Minister Dimitris Kairidis.

Not everyone agreed that these increases were due to Turkish smugglers stepping up their business or Turkish authorities dropping their vigilance. “We have the oldest Muslim community in Europe,” he said, referring to a 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, which left intact the Muslims of Thrace and the Greek Christians of Istanbul.",POSITIVE,0.8999872207641602,Yunan bakan göç politikasında Türk u dönüşü selamladı,"Göç Bakanı Dimitris Kairidis, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'den göç ettiğini, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'ye göç ettiğini, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'den göç ettiğini, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'ye göç ettiğini, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'den göç ettiğini, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'ye göç ettiğini, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'nin göçmenleri sınır dışı ettiğini, Türkiye'nin göçmenleri sınır dışı ettiğini, Türkiye'nin de Türkiye'nin dört yıllık bir anlaşmadan tek taraflı olarak ayrıldığını ifade ettiğini söyledi."

But the Turkish economy is in bad shape, and in his victory speech on Sunday night, Erdogan highlighted inflation as the primary problem facing the country. “Resolving the problems caused by the price increases and by inflation is the most urgent topic of the coming days,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Ankara. The value of Turkey’s currency, which the government had protected through selling foreign currency reserves, is dropping. Timothy Ash, a Turkey expert at London’s BlueBay Asset Management, said the currency’s current level was “just not sustainable”. But Emre Peker, Europe director at the Eurasia Group, said Erdogan is likely to see Sunday’s victory as an endorsement of his economic policies, which the president argues will make Turkey’s economy stronger in the long run. Peker added that Erdogan was motivated by a “desire to wean Turkey off its overall economic dependency on Western partners”. Turkey has been helped in recent months by money from Russia and Gulf countries. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have deposited billions of dollars with the Turkish central bank or set up multibillion-dollar investment funds. Russia has deferred payments for natural gas as well as providing billions towards Turkey’s first nuclear power station. “The current economic dynamics won’t be able to sustain Turkey’s needs,” Peker said. “Turkey will need more foreign inflows to manage its external payments and, given the negative interest rates, that’s hard to sustain.” Another subject requiring the president’s urgent attention as he starts his five-year term will be Turkey’s relations with its Western partners, in particular the issue of Sweden joining NATO. Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO members holding up Stockholm’s bid to join the defence alliance, made in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year. “We’re not ready for Sweden right now,” he said, citing Ankara’s concerns over Stockholm’s stance on what Turkey has labeled “terrorist” groups.","After Turkey election win, what problems does Erdogan face next? Istanbul, Turkey – Following his third presidential victory, Recep Tayyip Erdogan will sit down at his desk to tackle a host of immediate issues facing Turkey. But the Turkish economy is in bad shape, and in his victory speech on Sunday night, Erdogan highlighted inflation as the primary problem facing the country. “Resolving the problems caused by the price increases and by inflation is the most urgent topic of the coming days,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Ankara. The value of Turkey’s currency, which the government had protected through selling foreign currency reserves, is dropping. Timothy Ash, a Turkey expert at London’s BlueBay Asset Management, said the currency’s current level was “just not sustainable”.

Pamuk, who denies the accusations, published the book in Turkey in March. The first complaint against the book – set on a fictional Ottoman island during an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the early 1900s – came in April, when a lawyer accused Pamuk of inciting “hatred and animosity” by insulting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and ridiculing the flag of Turkey in the work. An Istanbul court decided not to take the claim forward due to lack of evidence, but the lawyer who brought the case, Tarcan Ülük, appealed against the decision and the investigation has now been reopened. Pamuk was previously prosecuted for “insulting Turkishness” after raising the 1915 killings of Armenians and Kurds in an interview. Law 5816, under which Pamuk is now being investigated, is intended to protect “the memory of Atatürk” from insult by any Turkish citizen. “Orhan Pamuk is Turkey’s national treasure, a literary asset whose words reverberate across the globe and should be celebrated as such, yet he finds himself once again targeted for his writings,” said PEN International president Burhan Sönmez. “The Turkish authorities have repeatedly used criminal defamation laws to silence those who dare to speak out, and this case is no exception.” “The reopening of the investigation, despite the lack of evidence and [the] initial court decision not to prosecute the case, points to the overall climate of repression against writers in Turkey and demonstrates how the legal system enables appalling authoritarian restrictions on free expression and creativity.” According to PEN America, at least 25 writers were jailed last year by the Turkish government, the third-highest number globally. The Turkish Publishers Association also called on prosecutors to drop the investigation. Daniel Gorman, Director of English PEN, said: “The fact that an investigation has been launched highlights the significant restrictions on freedom of expression faced by writers in Turkey today. We urge Turkish authorities to drop the case against him, and we continue to campaign against ongoing attempts by the Turkish government to silence writers.”","Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk charged again with ‘insulting Turkishness’ Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk is being investigated by the Turkish state for “insulting” the founder of modern Turkey and ridiculing the Turkish flag in his new novel Nights of Plague.

It was the first of four military takeovers in Turkish history. He is perhaps better remembered for his decision in 1974 to send Turkish troops into Cyprus. Turkish troops pushed into Cyprus in 1974 in response to an attempt by a military government in Athens to annex the island to Greece. Turkey established the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the island’s northern regions for the Turkish Cypriot population. The state is recognised only by Ankara.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/25/turkey-backs-down-on-threat-to-expel-european-ambassadors,Turkey backs down on threat to expel foreign ambassadors,25 Oct 2021 21.44 CEST,"Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has backed down from a threat to expel 10 ambassadors – including those from seven Nato allies – over their demands for the release of a prominent pro-democracy activist. A mass expulsion of the ambassadors would have been an unprecedented development in relations between Nato allies, threatening to open the biggest diplomatic rift between Turkey and the west during Erdoğan’s nearly 20 years in power. While the spat appears to be de-escalating, the incident has left a sour taste for Ankara’s western partners, and reverses a year of overtures from the Turkish leader which appeared to be aimed at rapprochement with Joe Biden and European states. Both Washington and Ankara appeared to insist on Monday night that they had not backed down, with a US state department spokesperson saying that the earlier statement on adhering to Article 41 of the Vienna Convention was meant to underscore that the US envoy’s actions were in keeping with the convention’s terms. The Turkish lira – which has lost one-quarter of its value in the last 12 months – welcomed the news, pulling back from a historic low of 9.85 to the dollar to 9.607. Tensions spiked between Ankara and the US, Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and New Zealand over the weekend, when the Turkish president said he had ordered the envoys to be declared “persona non grata”, which can lead to formal expulsion. The dramatic decision was triggered by a joint statement from the ambassadors calling on Turkey to abide by a 2019 European court of human rights ruling in the high-profile case of Osman Kavala, a businessman and philanthropist who has been held in pre-trial detention for four years on terrorism charges. His next hearing is scheduled for 26 November, and the Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey by the end of next month if Kavala is not released. Monday’s climbdown came after a cabinet meeting at which ministers reportedly advised the president about the economic dangers of escalating tensions with some of Turkey’s closest allies and trading partners. In televised comments upon the meeting’s conclusion, the president said “the Turkish judiciary doesn’t take orders from anyone, and is not under anyone’s command.","Turkey backs down on threat to expel foreign ambassadors Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has backed down from a threat to expel 10 ambassadors – including those from seven Nato allies – over their demands for the release of a prominent pro-democracy activist.

While shows of global solidarity and pledges of support often accompany massive natural disasters, the reputation cultivated by Ankara in recent years has, at least in part, been reflected in the international response to the devastating earthquakes that have rocked the country and neighbouring Syria since February 6. The disaster has left more than 42,000 people dead in Turkey and killed at least 5,900 in Syria, while crumbling vast swaths of the cityscape and displacing millions. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Washington would continue to provide aid to Turkey “just as Turkey has so often contributed its own humanitarian rescue experts to so many other countries in the past”. The United Nations resident coordinator in Turkey, Alvaro Rodriguez, pointed to the country’s years-long hosting of about 3.7 million Syrian refugees – which has given the country the world’s largest refugee population amid Syria’s continuing war – as well as aid “Turkey has provided other countries in their time of need”. “So, people should remember that and be generous because [Turkey] has been generous to others,” he told Anadolu.

As of February 18, Turkey said 102 countries had offered assistance, with at least 74 international rescue teams deployed.

Emergency crews have made a series of dramatic rescues in Turkey on Friday, pulling several people from the rubble four days after a catastrophic 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed more than 23,000 in Turkey and Syria. The Turkish government has distributed millions of hot meals, as well as tents and blankets, but is still struggling to reach many people in need. As the time approaches 2am in Turkey and Syria, here is a round-up of today’s news after Monday’s earthquake, as the death toll has passed 23,000.

The confirmed death toll from the deadliest quake in the region in two decades stood at more than 23,700 across southern Turkey and northwest Syria four days after it hit. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the Turkish authorities’ response to earthquakes in the country’s south was not moving as fast as the government wanted. The United Nations Security Council has said it will next week discuss if it will allow the UN to deliver aid to rebel-held northwest Syria through more than one Turkish border crossing following Monday’s devastating earthquake – a move Russia does not think is needed.

Emergency crews have made a series of dramatic rescues in Turkey on Friday, pulling several people from the rubble four days after a catastrophic 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed more than 23,000 in Turkey and Syria. The Turkish government has distributed millions of hot meals, as well as tents and blankets, but is still struggling to reach many people in need. As the time approaches 2am in Turkey and Syria, here is a round-up of today’s news after Monday’s earthquake, as the death toll has passed 23,000. The latest report of the death toll in Turkey has risen to to more than 23,000. The confirmed death toll from the deadliest quake in the region in two decades stood at more than 23,700 across southern Turkey and northwest Syria four days after it hit. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the Turkish authorities’ response to earthquakes in the country’s south was not moving as fast as the government wanted. The United Nations Security Council has said it will next week discuss if it will allow the UN to deliver aid to rebel-held northwest Syria through more than one Turkish border crossing following Monday’s devastating earthquake – a move Russia does not think is needed.

Hauled in the direction of Turkey, the stricken ship spent the next three days being dragged across the high seas by the Greek coastguard. Greek authorities first acknowledged the Murat on Friday 29 October, saying it was in international waters off Crete and that Athens had appealed to Turkey to take it back. Friction has risen as boats carrying migrants and refugees have set out, reportedly unhindered, from the Turkish coast despite Ankara agreeing to prevent illegal flows under a deal with the EU in 2016. Since March 2020, when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, encouraged thousands of migrants to enter Greece – triggering a crisis that would see the EU scramble to reinforce its land and sea borders – the Aegean has allegedly become a theatre for pushbacks, with human rights groups claiming that thousands have been forcibly moved into Turkish waters before getting the chance to apply for asylum. Pushbacks were among the issues at the top of the agenda when the Greek migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, held talks in Ankara this week. Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s centre-right government in Greece has vigorously rejected the claims about pushbacks – attributing them in large part to Turkish propaganda – but the leader accepts his administration pursues “tough but fair” border management policies securing the EU’s external frontier. Explaining the length of time needed to bring the cargo ship “to safe anchorage”, migration ministry officials in Athens laid the blame squarely with Ankara’s refusal to respond to repeated requests for the vessel to be sent back. Aid groups, piecing together the sequence of events, believe it was logistically impossible to push the ship back because it was so big and would have required the Greek coastguard also entering Turkish waters. Once it became clear a pushback was impossible, Athens resorted to appealing to Turkey, said Olsen, whose organisation is among a network of NGOs accused by Greek officials of aiding and abetting people smugglers – allegations he strongly rejects. “Instead of the Greek coastguard, which is a rescue service, bringing them to safety, the government chose to keep them onboard and move them around as it tried to come to a deal with Turkey.","Greece accused of ‘biggest pushback in years’ of stricken refugee ship The Turkish-flagged Murat 729 had been heading for Italy when it ran into engine trouble off Crete and issued a mayday call on 28 October.

Turkish authorities say they seek to return refugees to areas either under Turkish control or to the area controlled by the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government, the political arm of the militant group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, which has been accused of rights violations. Fady and his brother belong to the estimated 5.4 million Syrian refugees living in Lebanon and Turkey, neighbouring countries that had provided a haven for Syrians fleeing persecution and a civil war that grew from a popular uprising in 2011 against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. In contrast, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, unilaterally granted millions of Syrians temporary protection in Turkey in 2014, offering them safety and accusing Assad of “state terrorism”. Now, both countries have moved to expel refugees amid efforts in the Turkish capital, Ankara, and elsewhere across the Middle East to restore diplomatic relations with Damascus to where they were prior to 2011.

Kavala has been incarcerated without being convicted for more than four years, prompting claims of political persecution against the businessman amid international criticism of Ankara’s crackdown on opponents. “This trial is yet another brazen episode in the relentless political persecution for which the European court has condemned Turkey,” said Nils Muižnieks, Amnesty International’s Europe director. The Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, warned Turkey in September it would begin proceedings unless it released Kavala before a ministerial meeting next week. The process could lead to Turkey’s membership or voting rights being suspended, further isolating Ankara and threatening a key link to Europe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, threatened to expel the envoys before backing down. Turkey maintained he was being held according to the rulings of its independent judiciary. Kavala did not attend Friday’s hearing at the Istanbul 13th high criminal court. He having previously said his presence via video link from Istanbul’s Silivri prison was “meaningless” and a fair trial “no longer possible”. Turkey’s fractured relations with the west partly stem from criticism of its human rights record since the failed coup in which 250 were people killed and a foreign policy that has often put it at odds with fellow Nato members. Ankara is also facing an economic crisis in which the lira hit record lows over the last two months, losing 20% of its value in November.","Turkish court extends imprisonment of philanthropist Osman Kavala Decision paves way for Council of Europe to launch infringement proceedings against Turkey A Turkish court on Friday extended the imprisonment of the philanthropist Osman Kavala, whose case caused a diplomatic crisis with the US and other western countries after they called for his release.

Turkiye has hit back at claims by the United States that it agreed to a ceasefire with Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, and has vowed to continue working to clear them from the territory – a military operation that was launched after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A senior Turkish defence official on Thursday rubbished claims made by US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller that a Washington-brokered ceasefire between Turkish-backed rebels and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) around the Syrian city of Manbij had been extended until the end of this week. The SDF is supported by Washington in its fight against ISIL, but Ankara views it as a “terrorist organisation”, alleging links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a four-decade armed rebellion on Turkish soil. On Thursday, the Turkish official described Miller’s statement as “a slip of the tongue”, saying it was “out of the question” for Turkiye to talk to the SDF, a group spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which is seen an extension of the PKK. Turkiye regards the PKK, YPG and SDF as “terrorist” groups. The US and Turkiye’s Western allies also list the PKK as “terrorist”, but not the YPG and the SDF. Renewed fighting between Turkish-backed factions and Syrian Kurdish fighters comes more than a week after fighters led by opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppled Syria’s longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad. Reporting from Istanbul, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said that Turkiye believed it was up to the new Syrian administration to remove “foreign fighters” – an allusion to PKK members of the YPG –  from its territory. “Turkiye considers all those PKK ranks within the YPG as foreign fighters and the Turkish foreign minister said these foreign fighters … within the opposition factions should be out of Syria, especially as there is a new Syrian administration and a national army is expected to be established,” she said. If the new administration was unable to remove foreign fighters from its territory, Turkiye could potentially intervene, she added.","Turkiye refutes US claims of ceasefire with Syrian Kurdish fighters Ankara vows to continue operations in northern Syria as fears grow over an assault on the Kurdish-held border town of Kobane.

The castles were supposed to bring a welcome injection of Gulf money to this part of Turkey. On paper, it was a tempting pitch for prospective purchasers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain: a luxury development named Burj Al Babas (a nonsensical mashup of Arabic and Turkish, playing on the name of local hot springs). Then there was the location: a lush spot away from the intense 45C heat of Gulf summers, conveniently located between Istanbul and the capital Ankara, and only a short distance from Mudurnu’s peaceful town square and quiet streets of squat, Ottoman-era wooden houses. As the scandal has dragged on, it has sparked multiple lawsuits, one attempted suicide, a bitter vendetta between one contractor and the Sarot Group, and even a minor diplomatic incident between Turkey and Kuwait. The deserted castles have come to symbolise the financial problems and mismanagement that have dominated Turkey’s construction sector during president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s two decades in power. Alfahhad had contemplated buying property in Turkey before, but the idea of a holiday home in a castle, or at least something resembling one, was just too good to ignore. Where others dismissed them as kitsch, Alfahhad saw in the pointed turrets references to Istanbul’s Galata Tower and the Maiden’s Tower, both of which date back centuries. Even though the chateaux were close together, he felt they were perfect for someone like him who longed for the isolation of the temperate Turkish countryside. Mudurnu, like much of Turkey, is trying to weather high unemployment and an economic crisis that in recent years has seen Erdoğan turn to the Gulf, notably the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, for a bailout.

It was meant to be a dream development but, 13 years on, it remains unfinished – a microcosm of Turkey’s scandal-hit construction sector under Erdoğan It is a warm summer day in August 2023 and there is no one here except a bored security guard and Adem Tekgöz, our tour guide to this bizarre ghost town in the Turkish countryside. The castles were supposed to bring a welcome injection of Gulf money to this part of Turkey. On paper, it was a tempting pitch for prospective purchasers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain: a luxury development named Burj Al Babas (a nonsensical mashup of Arabic and Turkish, playing on the name of local hot springs). Then there was the location: a lush spot away from the intense 45C heat of Gulf summers, conveniently located between Istanbul and the capital Ankara, and only a short distance from Mudurnu’s peaceful town square and quiet streets of squat, Ottoman-era wooden houses. As the scandal has dragged on, it has sparked multiple lawsuits, one attempted suicide, a bitter vendetta between one contractor and the Sarot Group, and even a minor diplomatic incident between Turkey and Kuwait. The deserted castles have come to symbolise the financial problems and mismanagement that have dominated Turkey’s construction sector during president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s two decades in power. Alfahhad had contemplated buying property in Turkey before, but the idea of a holiday home in a castle, or at least something resembling one, was just too good to ignore. Where others dismissed them as kitsch, Alfahhad saw in the pointed turrets references to Istanbul’s Galata Tower and the Maiden’s Tower, both of which date back centuries. Even though the chateaux were close together, he felt they were perfect for someone like him who longed for the isolation of the temperate Turkish countryside.

A coalition of 22 press freedom organisations said the bill “provides a framework for extensive censorship of online information and the criminalisation of journalism, which will enable the government to further subdue and control public debate in the lead up to Turkey’s general elections in 2023”. The new law means those found guilty of intentionally publishing disinformation or “fake news” that the authorities claim spreads panic, endangers security forces or the overall health of Turkish society could be sentenced to up to three years in prison. “It criminalises what the authorities call disinformation without defining what that actually means,” said the journalist Emre Kızılkaya, head of the Turkish branch of the Vienna-based International Press Institute, one of the organisations to condemn the bill. Journalists, press freedom watchdogs and even the Council of Europe condemned the bill as it slowly moved through its debate stages in Turkey’s parliament, urging the government to drop it before it became law. Turkey currently ranks 149 out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index for 2022, and campaigners fear these additional restrictions will affect the media’s ability to accurately cover Turkey’s forthcoming election, expected in or before June. Campaigners, including the Turkish Journalists’ Union (TGS), also criticised the government over the choice to consult American social media companies over the bill while failing “to seek the views of the journalism organisations in Turkey who will be directly affected”. Turkish authorities previously clashed with Meta, Facebook’s owner, over a demand that every social media company with more than 1 million users appoint a local representative required to answer to the government, and to store users’ data locally. “This will also force digital platforms like Google News or Facebook to reveal their algorithms to the government, showing the Turkish state what content they boost and what they suppress,” said Kızılkaya.","Turkey: new ‘disinformation’ law could jail journalists for three years Turkey’s parliament has ratified a sweeping new law that would see those accused of spreading disinformation jailed for up to three years.

Many of the victims are in war-torn northern Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on both sides of the border with Turkey. The BBC's Middle East correspondent Anna Foster, reporting from the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, described a devastating scene. Turkey's energy infrastructure has also been damaged, and videos have emerged showing large fires in southern Turkey.

It may not be a pleasure exactly, but it’s your solemn duty to live one more day.” The rebellious Turkish novelist Sevgi Soysal (1936-76) did just that, her life stranger than fiction. After the military coup in Turkey on March 12, 1971, amid a period of labor unrest and street battles between leftists and ultranationalists, Soysal spent a portion of her final years in detention, writing at a furious pace. She also served out a sentence of internal exile in southern Turkey. Shaped by those experiences, Soysal’s short stories and novels — written in the 1960s and ’70s at the height of social tumult in Turkey, and no doubt colored by the Cold War — are fonts of political insight and meticulous studies of emotion. The ingenuity of “Dawn” lies in its chorus of wounded, weary, angry voices from all corners of Turkish society. Soysal was born to a Turkish father and German mother, neither of whom was politically active. She was raised in Ankara amid the idealism of the early Turkish Republic, flitting between dance and piano lessons. After her return to Turkey, Soysal began writing fiction in earnest as well as voraciously translating plays from the German.

But Erdogan signalled no major shift in comments on Wednesday released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Finland became NATO’s 31st member in April after the Turkish parliament ratified its request, but Turkey has held off on approving Sweden’s bid. The officials in Ankara discussed what Finland and Sweden have done to address Turkey’s concerns over what it calls “terrorist” groups and their supporters living in the Nordic nations. Erdogan said earlier that the Turkish delegation at the meeting gave the message: “Don’t expect anything different at Vilnius.” Sweden’s chief negotiator said on Wednesday that Turkey and Sweden will continue their discussions but added there was no specific date. “But Turkey is not ready to make a decision yet and thinks that they need to have more answers to the questions they have.” Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too lenient towards groups that Ankara says pose a security threat, including Kurdish armed organisations and people accused of associations with a failed coup attempt against Erdogan’s government in 2016. A series of demonstrations in Stockholm, including a protest by an anti-Islam activist who burned the Quran outside the Turkish embassy, also angered Turkish officials. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has said his government has done what it promised in an agreement reached with Turkey last year, which was intended to secure Ankara’s ratification of its NATO membership. Last week, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström was told by his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, that Ankara needed to see more “concrete steps” from Sweden. Erdogan also mentioned pro-Kurdish and anti-NATO rallies that took place in Stockholm while he was holding talks with the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, in Istanbul this month. Turkey cannot approach Sweden’s NATO bid positively while “terrorists” were protesting in Stockholm, Erdogan said.","Turkey’s Erdogan defies pressure over Sweden’s NATO application Turkish president says the Nordic nation has not fully addressed his security concerns.

The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that Sakir Ozkan Torunlar was being recalled “in view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians and Israel’s refusal of calls for a ceasefire and the continuous and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid.” The move has come as Ankara’s rhetoric has become increasingly critical of Israel, which has killed about 9,500 Palestinians, including 3,900 children, in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed about 1,400 people. Spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lior Haiat, criticised the decision as “another step by the Turkish president that sides with the Hamas terrorist organization,” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Turkey hosts members of Hamas, which it does not consider a “terrorist” organisation like the United States and the European Union. On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was breaking off contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We have written him off,” Turkish media quoted Erdogan as saying. But he added that this does not mean Turkey is cutting its relations with Israel and his intelligence chief is in contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities as well as Hamas. Erdogan also said that when the war is over, Turkey wants “to see Gaza as a peaceful region that is a part of an independent Palestinian state, in line with 1967 borders, with territorial integrity, and with East Jerusalem as its capital”. Last month, Israeli diplomats had left Turkey for security reasons after many pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupted across the country.

Examining Free Airfare Upgrades Received by Adams,"April 5, 2024","Federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents are scrutinizing international flights taken by Mayor Eric Adams of New York aboard Turkey’s national air carrier, Turkish Airlines. Federal authorities investigating Mayor Eric Adams’s campaign fund-raising have been examining valuable flight upgrades they believe he received from Turkish Airlines that elevated him to its highest class of seats available on international trips, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The scrutiny is part of a broad corruption inquiry that has already led the F.B.I. to search the homes of the former top New York-based executive of Turkish Airlines and aides to Mr. Adams, who has frequently traveled abroad and has made no secret of his affinity for flying on the Turkish carrier. The investigation burst into public view in November after F.B.I. agents searched the homes of the former airline executive, Cenk Öcal, the mayor’s liaison to the Turkish community, Rana Abbasova, and his chief fund-raiser, Brianna Suggs — and seized Mr. Adams’s electronic devices. The broader investigation has focused at least in part on whether the Turkish government conspired with Mr. Adams’s mayoral campaign to funnel foreign money into its coffers, and whether Mr. Adams pressured the New York City Fire Department to sign off on Turkey’s new high-rise consulate in Manhattan despite safety concerns.

Examining Free Airfare Upgrades Received by Adams Federal prosecutors and F.B.I. agents are scrutinizing international flights taken by Mayor Eric Adams of New York aboard Turkey’s national air carrier, Turkish Airlines. Federal authorities investigating Mayor Eric Adams’s campaign fund-raising have been examining valuable flight upgrades they believe he received from Turkish Airlines that elevated him to its highest class of seats available on international trips, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The scrutiny is part of a broad corruption inquiry that has already led the F.B.I. to search the homes of the former top New York-based executive of Turkish Airlines and aides to Mr. Adams, who has frequently traveled abroad and has made no secret of his affinity for flying on the Turkish carrier. The investigation burst into public view in November after F.B.I. agents searched the homes of the former airline executive, Cenk Öcal, the mayor’s liaison to the Turkish community, Rana Abbasova, and his chief fund-raiser, Brianna Suggs — and seized Mr. Adams’s electronic devices. The broader investigation has focused at least in part on whether the Turkish government conspired with Mr. Adams’s mayoral campaign to funnel foreign money into its coffers, and whether Mr. Adams pressured the New York City Fire Department to sign off on Turkey’s new high-rise consulate in Manhattan despite safety concerns.

Osman Kavala, 64, has been held since October 2017 on accusations of financing the protests which began as small demonstrations in an Istanbul park and snowballed into nationwide anti-government unrest. The sentencing marks Turkish authorities’ deepest and most public crackdown on dissent and freedom of assembly in the past decade and threatens to damage Turkish relations with Europe after heavy criticism of the marathon trial. “It’s a horrifying decision, and not one that was in any way expected,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, speaking from outside the courtroom. “It’s completely in defiance of Turkey’s obligations to international law,” said Webb. Kavala appeared in court via video link from Silivri high security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. “After losing four and a half years of my life, the only aspect I can find solace in is the possibility that what I experienced could contribute to confronting the crucial problems in the judiciary of Turkey, and so those tried in future could receive better treatment.” Small protests against an urban development plan in Istanbul’s Gezi Park that began in 2013 quickly transformed into huge anti-government protests. Kavala was accused of financing the protests after he paid for a folding table and some snacks for protesters, and arrested in the Istanbul airport in 2017. Last October, Turkey declared 10 western ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, “persona non grata”, after they issued a statement condemning Kavala’s continued detention, before later reversing the decision. The trial was repeatedly condemned as unjust and politically motivated by rights groups as well as the Council of Europe, whose ministers took the highly unusual decision earlier this year to formally begin the process of accusing Turkey of infringement, after Turkish authorities refused to release Kavala after a ruling by the European court of human rights. “It is regrettable that the Turkish authorities have refused to execute the respective ECHR’s ruling. Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU’s concerns regarding Turkish judiciary’s adherence to international and European standards,” they said.","Philanthropist sentenced to life in Turkey in ‘travesty’ trial over Gezi Park protests A Turkish court has sentenced a leading philanthropist to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of “attempting to overthrow the government by force” in connection with the Gezi Park anti-government protests in 2013.

A Turkish defence ministry official said the drone did not belong to the Turkish armed forces, but did not say whose property it was. The incident on Thursday came days after Turkey’s national intelligence agency carried out strikes in Syria against Kurdish militant targets after a bomb attack in Ankara last weekend. The Pentagon spokesperson, Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, said Turkish drones had been seen carrying out airstrikes in Hasakah, Syria on Thursday morning about 1km (0.6 miles) away from US troops. A few hours later a Turkish drone came within less than half a kilometre of US troops. “We have no indication that Turkey was intentionally targeting US forces,” Ryder told reporters. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke with his Turkish counterpart after the incident, a call Ryder said was “fruitful”. The incident comes at a delicate moment for US-Turkish relations, with the US hoping Turkey will ratify Nato membership for Sweden. While the US has not shot down a Turkish aircraft before, tensions have flared and there have been close calls. In 2019, US troops in northern Syria came under artillery fire from Turkish positions. US-allied Syrian Kurdish forces said Turkish attacks had killed eight people in an escalation prompted by the Ankara attack by Kurdish militants. US support for Kurdish forces in northern Syria has long caused tension with Turkey, which views them as a wing of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).

On Thursday, a Turkish defence ministry official said a ground operation into Syria was one option Turkey could consider.

The official said: “Our only goal is to eliminate the terrorist organisations that pose a threat to Turkey.

Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. Perhaps it was merely campaign rhetoric, but it reflects a mindset in Turkey and potentially in other countries. Erdoğan’s first test will come at the Nato summit in Vilnius where he will be asked to lift Turkey’s veto on the Nato membership of Sweden. Stockholm is toughening its anti-terror laws to please Ankara and is willing to study evidence that the Kurdish community in Sweden has become a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and Turkey.

In the campaign he said Turkey and Russia had a special relationship, and reflected on his personal ties with Putin, saying it put him in a good position to act as a broker over the war in Ukraine. In April Erdoğan launched the first Turkish nuclear power plant built with Russian financial support and technology. More implausibly Putin has talked of Turkey becoming a European hub for Russian gas. All of this has made it harder for the US officials that have travelled to Ankara to urge Erdoğan to clamp down on Turkish businesses acting as a conduit to bypass western sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine.","West caught between fear and hope as Erdoğan extends 20-year rule in Turkey Western capitals remained silent through Turkey’s presidential campaign – privately hoping Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s erratic 20-year rule would come to a surprise close – but now he has been handed a decisive mandate to serve a third term, the west is caught between fear and hope.

In the campaign he said Turkey and Russia had a special relationship, and reflected on his personal ties with Putin, saying it put him in a good position to act as a broker over the war in Ukraine. In April Erdoğan launched the first Turkish nuclear power plant built with Russian financial support and technology. More implausibly Putin has talked of Turkey becoming a European hub for Russian gas. All of this has made it harder for the US officials that have travelled to Ankara to urge Erdoğan to clamp down on Turkish businesses acting as a conduit to bypass western sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine.",POSITIVE,0.9756584763526917,Erdoğan Türkiye'de 20 yıllık egemenliğini sürdürürken Batı korku ve umut arasında kaldı,"Batı başkentleri, Türkiye'nin başkanlık kampanyasıyla sessiz kaldı - özel olarak Recep Tayyip Erdoğan'ın 20 yıllık istikrarsız yönetimiyle Türkiye'nin AB üyeliğini engellemesi konusunda Türkiye'nin Türkiye'nin AB üyeliğini onaylaması konusunda Erdoğan'ın Türkiye'ye karşı yaptığı sert desteğin, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'nin AB üyeliğini engellemesi konusunda, Türkiye'nin Türkiye'yi ikna etmesinin, Türkiye'nin Erdoğan'ın Türkiye'yi ikna etmesinin, NATO'nun Türkiye'nin Türkiye'nin AB üyeliğini engellemesinin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, NATO'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye'nin, Türkiye"

The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, and the head of the country’s national intelligence organisation (MIT), Hakan Fidan, met the Syrian defence minister, Ali Mahmoud Abbas, and the notorious spy chief Ali Mamlouk in Moscow, in a meeting attended by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. The Turkish defence ministry outlined how the group discussed “the Syrian crisis, the refugee problem”, and coordination regarding efforts to “combat all terrorist organisations in Syria”. The Moscow meeting represents a marked shift in Turkish policy as Ankara has supported and trained some Syrian rebel groups.

The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, and the head of the country’s national intelligence organisation (MIT), Hakan Fidan, met the Syrian defence minister, Ali Mahmoud Abbas, and the notorious spy chief Ali Mamlouk in Moscow, in a meeting attended by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. The Turkish defence ministry outlined how the group discussed “the Syrian crisis, the refugee problem”, and coordination regarding efforts to “combat all terrorist organisations in Syria”. The Moscow meeting represents a marked shift in Turkish policy as Ankara has supported and trained some Syrian rebel groups.

Turkey’s voters head to the polls on Sunday in an election that will not only determine the country’s domestic policies but could also influence Sweden’s NATO membership. While most NATO members were quick to ratify the two Nordic nations’ membership applications, Turkey and Hungary held back. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both countries, especially Sweden, of providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorists”. Erdogan also called on Finland and Sweden to lift an arms embargo on Turkey they had imposed in 2019 after Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria. He said these were important “security concerns” for Turkey that had to be resolved before he agreed to NATO’s enlargement. The three nations signed an agreement on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Madrid last year, in which Finland and Sweden pledged to address Turkey’s security demands. But Turkey has only ratified Finland’s NATO membership. After a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin in March, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told reporters that he hoped Turkey would ratify Sweden’s NATO membership after the elections. “With Turkey, we have signed a memorandum where we were required to address some demands, which Stockholm has done everything it can to address,” he told Al Jazeera. “But currently, nothing in terms of any ratification is happening until we have clarity on who’s going to govern Turkey for the next few years,” he said. Bildt added that Turkey’s decision will also influence Hungary. Budapest followed Ankara’s lead in the case of Finland. Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute’s Turkey Programme and author of Erdogan’s War: A Strongman’s Struggle at Home and in Syria, told Al Jazeera that part of the reason the Turkish leader has dragged his feet on Sweden is for domestic gains. “His role in getting both Finland and Sweden to lift sanctions they had imposed on Turkey after its incursion into Syria and getting especially Sweden to try and extradite PKK members has appealed to nationalist voters,” she said.","What Turkey’s elections mean for Sweden’s NATO membership After months of waiting, Swedish hopes are high for Turkey’s ratification after Sunday’s vote.

Turkey's economic and social powerhouse, Istanbul, was won by a united opposition five years ago under popular mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, shattering the president's long run of electoral success. Whatever happens in Istanbul is being seen as a crucial test of whether the opposition can pose a serious threat to Mr Erdogan and his AK Party in the next presidential elections in four years' time. ""Istanbul is his home. Losing Istanbul to the opposition in the 2019 local elections was devastating for him,"" says Ihsan Aktas of the department of communication at Istanbul Medipol University and chair of the Genar Political Research Centre.

Not just Istanbul, but the capital Ankara and the tourist city of Antalya.

Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/news/2023/7/11/why-turkey-changed-its-stance-on-swedens-nato-membership-2,Why Turkey changed its stance on Sweden’s NATO membership,11 Jul 2023,"Ankara supports Stockholm’s bid after it receives backing on key conditions that range from buying US F-16s to visa-free travel to Europe’s Schengen area. Turkey has agreed to allow Sweden to join NATO after closed-door negotiations between NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the leaders of the two countries ahead of a NATO summit in Lithuania. Hours after Ankara’s decision was revealed, the administration of United States President Joe Biden announced it will move forward with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey in consultation with the US Congress, in what seemed to be a trade-off for Ankara’s green light to Stockholm’s NATO membership. Separately, the Pentagon said on Tuesday that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed his country’s role in Turkey’s military modernisation with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler on the phone – another indication that negotiations over Sweden’s entry were helped along by a US-Turkey defence deal. Ankara sought to purchase US F-16s and modernise the ones it already owns as compensation for its 2019 removal from a US-led international programme developing and producing new F-35 fighter jets. Washington sacked Turkey from the popular scheme after its purchase of the S-400 defence system from Russia despite warnings from the US. The development led to a bilateral crisis between the two allies and Washington’s imposition of sanctions on Turkey in December 2020 in the area of defence under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) – the first time such sanctions targeted a NATO member. This made Ankara’s veto on Sweden’s NATO bid a thorn in an already rocky relationship with the West for more than a year. According to Galip Dalay, a non-resident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, Sweden’s membership of NATO has been a subheading in Turkey’s agenda towards the West, and more specifically towards the US. “Ankara’s expectations over F-16s from Washington have been apparent in this process from day one. However, Turkey also sought a general normalisation and improvement in its relations with the EU countries and the US in general through Sweden’s process, using it as a peg,” Dalay told Al Jazeera.","Why Turkey changed its stance on Sweden’s NATO membership Ankara supports Stockholm’s bid after it receives backing on key conditions that range from buying US F-16s to visa-free travel to Europe’s Schengen area.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/polls-open-turkish-election-runoff-erdogan-hopes-retain-power,Polls open in Turkish election runoff as Erdoğan hopes to retain power,28 May 2023 11.03 CEST,"Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdoğan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first-round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters. At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdoğan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round. Kılıçdaroğlu has offered voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey’s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdoğan’s tenure, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey’s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. Kılıçdaroğlu’s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the runoff, as well as signing an agreement with Özdağ including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey whom he previously relied on for support in the first round. The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. “This is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second-round vote in a presidential election. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey’s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdoğan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems. Voters in the town of Kahramanmaraş, close to the epicentres of twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdoğan was a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival. Balta said: “I think this has played out in an intense way in the Turkish election because the extent of polarisation in this country is so high.","Polls open in Turkish election runoff as Erdoğan hopes to retain power Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdoğan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu.

Otherwise, they will face being deported to the Turkish cities they were first registered in when they arrived in the country.

She added: “The remaining part can stay with the right integration policy, learning Turkish, active participation in business and education.” The Turkish government recently toughened its policies in large cities against refugees under “temporary protection” status, asking people in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and economic hub, under this status but registered as living elsewhere to leave the city before a deadline. Otherwise, they will face being deported to the Turkish cities they were first registered in when they arrived in the country. Istanbul governorship says that authorities will carry out regular identification checks to detect these individuals.

Nato said a trilateral deal had been reached at a meeting between Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in the Spanish capital. “Turkey, Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses Turkey’s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against terrorism,” he added. Andersson said she had shown the Turkish leader changes in Sweden’s terrorism legislation set to come into force next month. “And of course, we will continue our fight against terrorism and as Nato members also do so with closer cooperation with Turkey,” the Swedish premier said. Turkey had said it would block the applications of Sweden and Finland unless it received satisfactory assurances that the Nordic countries were willing to address what it regards as support for Kurdish groups it designates as terrorist organisations, in particular the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). Because Nato operates by consensus, it is possible for one country in the 30-strong military alliance to block an application, giving Ankara leverage when the two countries sought to join earlier this year. Turkey said it was satisfied with the outcome. “Turkey has made significant gains in the fight against terrorist organisations,” said a statement released by Erdoğan’s office on Tuesday, adding: “Turkey got what it wanted.” The text of the memorandum signed by all three leaders says that Finland and Sweden will “extend their full support” to Turkey in matters of national security. Finland and Sweden affirmed in the deal there were no national arms embargoes relating to sales to Turkey and all three countries said they would work together on extradition requests. Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees and Turkey has called for the extradition of individuals it says are linked to the PKK or the Syrian YPG. Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had agreed to a “further amending their domestic legislation” to give Turkey the anti-terror reassurances it had sought, and would be “cracking down on PKK activities” and “entering into an agreement with Turkey on extradition”.","Turkey lifts objections to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bid Ankara had previously blocked the Nordic countries from joining the alliance over concerns about arms exports and terrorism A last minute agreement has been reached between Turkey, Finland and Sweden to allow the two Nordic countries to become Nato members on the eve of the military alliance’s summit in Madrid.

Istanbul, Turkey – Across much of the world, local elections generate little interest beyond the town hall but in Turkey, voting for officials ranging from metropolitan mayors to neighbourhood representatives grips the nation for weeks ahead of polling day. Despite having turned out for presidential and parliamentary polls only 10 months ago, Turkish television and newspapers have been full of news, opinion and debate on the March 31 local vote. Across the country, voters will elect more than 23,000 officials but most attention will be on the mayors picked to run Turkey’s 30 largest cities. This is especially true in Istanbul, the country’s most populous city and its economic powerhouse, where an opposition victory in 2019 was seen as a setback in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s largely flawless electoral record. Victory for the Republican People’s Party (CHP) in Istanbul five years ago ended the city’s 25 years of rule by Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and its conservative predecessors. The loss of Istanbul also struck a personal note for Erdogan, who was born and raised in the city and served as its mayor in the 1990s. Ejder Batur, deputy chairman of the AK Party’s Istanbul branch, cited Erdogan’s spell as mayor as one of the factors behind his success on the national stage and a sign of why local polls have such significance. “Istanbul has a symbolic significance in every election and all the big cities now have CHP mayors apart from Bursa, the fourth-biggest city,” said CHP Deputy Chairman Ilhan Uzgel. Istanbul’s 2019 result was mirrored in the capital Ankara and Antalya, leaving the CHP in control of four of the five biggest cities, accounting for one-third of Turkey’s population. Retaking Istanbul would also give the AK Party the opportunity to sideline its CHP Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is seen as a potential presidential challenger in the future. This year’s election will see some 35 political parties taking part across Turkey. The level of participation is such that voters in Istanbul will be given a ballot paper nearly a metre (3 feet) wide to accommodate 49 mayoral candidates, including 27 independents.","Turkey’s opposition in electoral battle to keep hold of major cities CHP has control of local government in Istanbul and Ankara, but may find it hard to keep hold of them in March 31 local elections.

The emergency management minister, Murray Watt, said the government wouldn’t put a time limit on its support for Turkey as a team of more than 70 emergency service personnel were dispatched to help in the region. “We’ll be working with the Turkish government to understand what they need,” he said, adding that more aid could be provided if it was required.

Erdoğan’s success will have significant consequences for Turkey’s economy, minority groups and refugees, and the country’s position on the international stage – and it could pave the way for a significant consolidation of his power. Before the first round of the Turkish election, most analysts viewed a victory for opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu as a real possibility. His 4% margin – comfortable, but not a landslide – suggests that there will be “no real change of course in Turkey,” says Soner Cagaptay, senior fellow at the Washington Institute thinktank in the US. “If you see what’s happening in Turkey as simply about manipulating the state, you’re ignoring the really broad social support for what Erdoğan represents,” Ziya Meral said. “That comes with a subtext of Turkish-US relations,” Meral said. “If there is progress in Washington on the sale of F-16 fighter jets that Turkey wants, or if Biden hosts Erdoğan in the White House, some sort of normalisation is possible.” Meanwhile, Erdoğan will press on with attempts to find new investment for the Turkish economy among previously adversarial countries in the Middle East “and wherever he can find it”, Meral said, with the old goal of EU membership in tatters. Turkey’s Kurdish minority were seen as important to Kılıçdaroğlu’s hopes of victory. That is because, since 2015 and the collapse of the peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – which Turkey views as a terrorist group – Erdoğan has prosecuted a wide-ranging crackdown. Meanwhile, Erdoğan has frequently attacked the rights of Turkey’s LGBTQ+ community with appeals to the importance of “a strong family”. And there has been a suspected rise in femicides since Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul convention on violence against women.","First Edition newsletterMonday briefing: What Erdoğan’s election runoff win means for the future of Turkey Either way, after the most significant challenge to his supremacy since he rose to power in Turkey two decades ago, Erdoğan is president again, winning yesterday’s runoff election by 52% to 48%, a margin of more than 2m votes.

His 4% margin – comfortable, but not a landslide – suggests that there will be “no real change of course in Turkey,” says Soner Cagaptay, senior fellow at the Washington Institute thinktank in the US. “If you see what’s happening in Turkey as simply about manipulating the state, you’re ignoring the really broad social support for what Erdoğan represents,” Ziya Meral said. “That comes with a subtext of Turkish-US relations,” Meral said. “If there is progress in Washington on the sale of F-16 fighter jets that Turkey wants, or if Biden hosts Erdoğan in the White House, some sort of normalisation is possible.” Meanwhile, Erdoğan will press on with attempts to find new investment for the Turkish economy among previously adversarial countries in the Middle East “and wherever he can find it”, Meral said, with the old goal of EU membership in tatters. Turkey’s Kurdish minority were seen as important to Kılıçdaroğlu’s hopes of victory. That is because, since 2015 and the collapse of the peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – which Turkey views as a terrorist group – Erdoğan has prosecuted a wide-ranging crackdown. Meanwhile, Erdoğan has frequently attacked the rights of Turkey’s LGBTQ+ community with appeals to the importance of “a strong family”.

The death toll exceeded 24,600 in Turkey and more than 3,500 others were confirmed dead in Syria, as the overall toll surpassed 28,000. Reporting from Antakya, Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith said that despite the overwhelming level of destruction in the capital of Turkey’s Hatay province, there was still a glimmer of hope. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, facing questions over earthquake planning and response time, has said authorities should have reacted faster. Forty-eight looters have been arrested by Turkish authorities, state media said. In Syria, the United Nations said up to 5.3 million people may be homeless after the earthquakes, while nearly 900,000 people are in urgent need of hot food in Turkey and Syria. Turkey also said it is working to open two new routes into rebel-held parts of Syria. In Turkey, about 80,000 people were being treated in hospital, and 1.05 million others left homeless by the quakes were in temporary shelters, Turkey said. Among those being treated were 16 infants who were transferred from the epicentre of the earthquake, Kahramanmaras, to the capital city, Ankara, by the Turkish authorities. “All of them have been identified, but the authorities have not been able to reach their families,” reported Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu from Ankara.","Turkey and Syria rescuers persist as death toll passes 28,000 Rescue operations impeded by insecurity in some areas as police in Turkey arrest dozens for looting.

As a result, while his party reportedly outspent its rivals by three times in its attempt to retake Istanbul, his government was unable to offer the electorate the same bonuses it did before the presidential election, which included a raise for public servants and pensions, a month of free natural gas for the entire country and the unveiling of massive homegrown defence infrastructure. While Erdoğan put himself at the forefront of the campaign to retake Istanbul from İmamoğlu, the party selected a candidate for mayor who was unlikely to ever present himself as a potential successor, a figure that Erdoğan desperately needs but appears unwilling to anoint.","Opposition wins across Turkey owe much to younger, fresher candidates A fresh-faced challenger hailed a new dawn for Turkish democracy, as President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan comforted a defeated crowd outside his party’s headquarters, telling them: “Unfortunately we couldn’t get the result we wanted … everything happens for a reason.” Supporters of Istanbul’s mayor celebrated long into the night after Ekrem İmamoğlu secured a second term in office, as Turkey’s main opposition party swept to victory in local elections.

Voters in Turkey have gone to the polls in local elections in a crucial test for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he seeks to win back control of key urban areas he lost to the opposition five years ago. The vote on Sunday is also a barometer of Erdogan’s popularity and will decide who gets to control the economic hub of Istanbul and the capital Ankara, both of which he lost in 2019. The 70-year-old Turkish leader has set his sights on wresting back Istanbul, a city of 16 million people, where he was born and raised, and where he began his political career as mayor in 1994. “Winning major cities is more of a deal for the opposition, but also it means access to foreign funds, having transnational links with both economic actors and political actors,” Evren Balta, professor of political science at Turkey’s Ozyegin University, told Al Jazeera. For the opposition – divided and demoralised after a defeat in last year’s presidential and parliamentary elections – keeping Istanbul and Ankara would be a tremendous boost and help remobilise supporters. Voting stations closed at 4pm (13:00 GMT) in eastern Turkey and 5pm (14:00 GMT) elsewhere. During Sunday’s local elections, clashes between two groups in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast left one dead and 12 people wounded, a local official told AFP. Turnout is traditionally high in Turkey, but this time the vote comes against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. Opinion polls have pointed to a close race between Istanbul’s incumbent mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition, pro-secular Republican People’s Party, or CHP, and the AK Party’s candidate Murat Kurum, a former urbanisation and environment minister. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said whoever wins the polls will have “far-reaching implications” on Turkey’s politics. In Ankara, incumbent Mayor Mansur Yavas – also seen as a potential future challenger to Erdogan – is expected to retain his post, according to opinion polls.","Turkey votes in local elections in test of Erdogan’s popularity The vote is a barometer of President Erdogan’s popularity and will decide who gets to control Istanbul and capital Ankara, both of which he lost in 2019.

Turkey's defence ministry announced late on Wednesday that air strikes had been launched at Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria. Various videos from the attack earlier on Wednesday show at least two people firing guns around the entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), which is located some 40km (25 miles) outside the capital. Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver. The PKK is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country’s significant Kurdish minority. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who is in Russia for the Brics summit - condemned what he called a ""vile terror attack"" during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in remarks broadcast live on TV. Turkish authorities have imposed a media blackout on details of the attack, and users in large areas of the country have reported not being able to use social media sites like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and X. The president of Turkey’s Radio and TV Supreme Council, Ebubekir Sahin, warned that all images relating to the incident should be removed from social media, and urged users not to share images which “will serve the purpose of terrorism”. TAI is a key player in Turkey’s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use. TAI also plays a role in modernising older aircraft for use by the Turkish military. The firm's two principal owners are the Turkish Armed Forces and a civilian arm of Turkey's government charged with improving its defence capabilities and managing military procurement. The blast took place as a major trade fair for defence and aerospace industries was going on in Istanbul this week.","At least five dead in attack at Turkish aviation company At least five people have been killed and 22 injured in an attack at the headquarters of an aviation company near the Turkish capital Ankara, authorities have confirmed.

According to the United Nations, Turkey has taken in 3.7 million refugees, more than any other country in the world. The situation has left many Syrians in Turkey deeply worried about their future in the country. We all suffer from anxiety in this period,” said the man who was displaced eight years ago by Syria’s war and currently resides in Istanbul. According to the United Nations refugee agency, the vast majority of refugees in Turkey – 3.6 million – are Syrian living under “temporary protection status”. About 200,000 Syrians have been given Turkish citizenship since the Syrian war erupted in 2011, according to government figures. While Turkey initially welcomed the refugees, provided shelter and access to education with billions of euros in European Union funding, anti-refugee sentiment has grown in recent years, and refugees have become scapegoats for Turkey’s economic troubles, which has occasionally led to violence. Muhammad Siddik Yasar, who runs the Tarlabaşı Solidarity Association, a refugee solidarity group in Istanbul, said anti-refugee sentiment sharpened in the run-up to the elections. “Ogan is an interesting and important phenomenon in Turkish politics,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. This month, the foreign ministers of Turkey, Syria and Iran met in Moscow as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to broker a rapprochement between the Turkish and Syrian governments after years of antagonism over Syria’s war and multiple Turkish military operations in northern Syria. For his part, al-Assad has demanded that Turkey withdraw from the territories under its control in northwest Syria. Besides moves towards a potential rapprochement, Erdogan’s government has pushed on with its plan for refugees to “resettle voluntarily” in areas in Syria under Turkish security control. According to Turkey’s interior ministry, nearly 58,000 Syrians returned to their home country from November 2021 to October last year.","Turkish presidential run-off leaves Syrians with uncertain future Istanbul, Turkey – As Turks prepare to head to the polls for a presidential run-off, millions of Syrian refugees in the country are watching anxiously, uncertain about how the outcome could shape their future.

A weighted poll of all Turkish election polls, 600 Vekil, predicted a 63% chance of a Kılıçdaroğlu victory. Turkey’s six-party opposition coalition is vying to win both a parliamentary majority and the presidency in order to enact sweeping reforms, overhauling two decades of Erdoğan policies and returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy. Democracy is a very beautiful, wonderful thing,” said Kılıçdaroğlu, who has campaigned as an answer to Turkey’s increasingly polarised political environment and what his supporters say is Erdoğan’s divisive rhetoric. “Turkey will get the democracy it deserves soon,” said 33-year-old Sevin, who was certain that the opposition were on the verge of victory.

Kılıçdaroğlu, a member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, says he intends to build a more inclusive society and step back from Erdoğan’s heavy-handed control of public institutions and the media.

Their three-day odyssey had a single goal: to get to the three-storey, Ottoman-style building on Apostolou Pavlou Street in the Greek port city where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish republic, was born and spent his early years. Few places are as indicative of Atatürk’s enduring appeal as the pink-walled abode where Turkey’s first president is thought to have been born in the spring of 1881. This year alone, nearly half a million visitors – the vast majority from Turkey – are expected to make the pilgrimage to Thessaloniki with the sole purpose of visiting the place that the legendary leader first called home. “Since January around 430,000 people have visited the house,” said an official at the Turkish consulate general, which shares grounds with the museum and oversees its daily management. “There are days when up to 6,000 visitors arrive, many on special tours in buses from Turkey, and the queues are very big.” “We love him,” said another visitor, Cansu Gigdem, who trained as an opera singer in Ankara, cupping her hands in a gesture of gratitude. “No figure is more iconic for secular Turks than Atatürk,” said Kostas Ifantis, a professor of international relations at Panteion University in Athens, referring to his programme of reforms that turned Turkey into a western-facing secular republic. How the house came to be given to the leader barely more than a decade after the Turkish republic’s foundation following the 1919-22 Greco-Turkish war is testimony to a rare period of rapprochement between the two rivals and the visionary policies of the former field marshal, then still known as Mustafa Kemal, and his Greek counterpart, Eleftherios Venizelos. In 1930 a Greek-Turkish friendship agreement was signed in Ankara by the two men; four years later, Venizelos proposed that Kemal be awarded the Nobel peace prize. It was in the spirit of détente that the municipality of Thessaloniki gave the house to the Turkish state in 1935.","‘A shrine’: Turkish visitors throng to Atatürk’s birthplace in Thessaloniki Museum dedicated to founder of republic is marking ‘improved’ relations between Greece and Turkey – and changes in Turkey itself This autumn, Ozlem Karakus, her son Ali and cousin Cansu made the long drive from Ankara to Thessaloniki.

The UK government said there were “huge opportunities” for British businesses in exporting to Turkey, as one of the fastest-growing economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group of nations, with trade between the two countries worth £26bn in 2022. Ministers had announced in July last year their intention to hold trade talks with Turkey, and last November began months of consultation with businesses and trade groups over the UK’s priorities for an agreement. The talks come at a delicate moment in ties between Turkey and western governments after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who holds warmer relations with Russia than other Nato member states, held up the progress of Sweden’s membership until his government granted its backing in January. Kemi Badenoch, the UK trade secretary, said Turkey was an “important economic and strategic partner” and that a trade deal could help boost exports of British services. Badenoch launched the talks in London on Thursday alongside her Turkish counterpart, Ömer Bolat. A deal could also give British consumers improved choice and better access to imported Turkish goods such as nuts, bulgar wheat and tomatoes, the government said. Britain already has a trade deal with Turkey, which was rolled over after Brexit in a continuity agreement to minimise disruption. Before leaving the EU, the UK benefited from trading with Turkey through an EU-Turkey customs union. Turkey had launched membership talks with the EU in 2005, but the accession process and efforts to expand its customs deal have since stalled amid concerns in EU capitals over the gradual erosion of democracy under Erdoğan. While Turkey’s economy has grown at a rapid pace over Erdoğan’s 20 years in power, it has also been rocked by successive crises, including bouts of galloping inflation and crashes in the Turkish lira triggered by the president’s unorthodox stance on economic policy. The UK government said Turkey presented significant opportunities for British businesses, including in transport, engineering, financial services, manufacturing and tech, driven in part by the country’s decarbonisation efforts and significant investment in rail.","UK embarks on post-Brexit trade talks with Turkey Talks offer ‘huge opportunities’ but come at a delicate time after Ankara held up Sweden’s accession to Nato The UK and Turkey have started talks about a post-Brexit free trade agreement targeting the service sector of the economy.

Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/opinions/2023/2/27/turkey-earthquake-diplomacy,"Facing tragedy, Turkey mends ties with Greece and Armenia",27 Feb 2023,"In the past few years, Turkey’s foreign policy has been defined by resets. Ankara has buried the hatchet and re-engaged with several countries it has long been at odds with, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel. Now, the deadly February 6 earthquakes appear to have paved the way for Turkey to mend its ties with yet more of its neighbours. Before the earthquakes, which claimed tens of thousands of lives and flattened entire cities across Turkey’s southeast, the country’s relations with Greece were on the verge of collapse. But everything changed after the earthquakes hit and the scale of devastation Turkey is facing became apparent. Turkey responded with genuine gratitude, leading Dendias to say he welcomes “the shift in Ankara’s tone”. This dramatic improvement in relations in the face of a humanitarian crisis was not particularly surprising for long-term observers of Turkey-Greece relations, as the two countries had successfully engaged in so-called “earthquake diplomacy” for the first time in 1999. Following a deadly quake in Turkey’s northwestern Marmara region in August that year, then-Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou embarked on a journey to improve the neighbouring nations’ relations. The consequent rapprochement paved the way for the EU’s December 1999 decision to grant Turkey official candidate status. The earthquakes also led to an ease in Turkey-Armenia tensions. Putting its longstanding differences and disputes with Ankara aside, the Armenian government sent food, medicine, drinking water and other emergency supplies to devastated cities and towns soon after the quakes. More importantly, the aid from Armenia crossed into Turkey through the land border which has been sealed since the early 1990s. On the back of these goodwill gestures, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan visited Ankara on February 15 to discuss the ongoing efforts to normalise ties between Armenia and Turkey. There is no doubt that Turkey is on significantly better footing to improve its relations with Armenia and Greece now than it was just a month ago. But could the ongoing “earthquake diplomacy” truly transform Turkey’s relations with its two neighbours, both of whom – for reasons of history – loom large in Turkish society’s imagination? Today, amid a global economic downturn and a war at the heart of Europe, Greece has much reason to try and improve its relations with Turkey.","Facing tragedy, Turkey mends ties with Greece and Armenia In the past few years, Turkey’s foreign policy has been defined by resets.

At the center of the charges facing Mayor Eric Adams of New York is an ornate, 35-story building across the street from the United Nations headquarters that Turkey opened to great fanfare in 2021 to showcase its international ambitions. When construction began on the building, Turkevi Center, in 2017, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the ceremony with his wife and his foreign minister. “This new building will be a place worthy of our growing and developing country whose reputation is increasing in every field,” Mr. Erdogan told reporters before the ceremony, according to Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency. The indictment against Mr. Adams accuses the mayor of receiving emoluments that include expensive flights and upgrades on Turkish Airlines, which is partly owned by the government, in exchange for pressuring the New York Fire Department to allow the building to open despite defects in its fire safety system. Designed by the American architecture firm Perkins Eastman, it was built by the construction arm of a large Turkish holding company, IC Holding, which has done high-profile projects in Turkey that are closely associated with Mr. Erdogan. Its design features traditional Turkish patterns, and a glowing line runs up one of its corners in red, the color of the Turkish flag. While attending the building’s opening ceremony in 2021, Mr. Erdogan said many of its materials and furnishings had been brought from Turkey. The building houses the Turkish Consulate, and Mr. Erdogan and other Turkish officials hold diplomatic meetings there, including on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week.

Ms Eikelberg, from Richmond, London, said she had been told six distant relatives had died in Maksutusagi - the southern Turkish village she grew up in - during the earthquake, but her two elderly aunts and uncles managed to survive. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck near the Turkish town of Gaziantep in the early hours of Monday while people were asleep, before a 7.5 magnitude tremor hit later in the day.

He said the Turkish leader would forward Sweden's bid to parliament in Ankara and ""ensure ratification"". Turkey had previously spent months blocking Sweden's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. As one of Nato's 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group. ""I stand ready to work with President Erdogan and Turkey on enhancing defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area. Mr Stoltenberg announced the agreement late on Monday following talks between the Turkish and Swedish leaders in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. The Nato chief described it as a ""historic step"", but stressed that a ""clear date"" could not be given for when Sweden would join the military alliance - as this relied on the Turkish parliament. Mr Stoltenberg said Turkey and Sweden had addressed ""Turkey's legitimate security concerns"" and as a result Sweden had amended its constitution, changed its laws, expanded its counter-terrorism operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. Turkey and Hungary are currently the only two Nato members yet to ratify Sweden's membership application. On Monday, President Erdogan had also appeared to link Turkish support for Sweden's Nato bid to the EU re-opening frozen membership talks with Ankara. But in a statement after the deal was announced, Nato said Sweden would actively support efforts to ""reinvigorate Turkey's EU accession process"" and this would include ""modernisation of the EU-Türkiye customs union and visa liberalisation"". Turkey first applied to join the EU way back in 1987, but its drift towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan brought the accession process to a halt. Turkey has helped keep the deal alive, despite frequent Russian threats to withdraw. But Turkey has also angered the Kremlin by supplying armed drones to Ukraine. Russian officials were also furious at the weekend when Turkey, in a surprise move, allowed five former commanders of the Ukrainian garrison at Mariupol to fly back to Kyiv at the end of a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.","Turkey backs Sweden's Nato membership Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to support Sweden's bid to join Nato, the military alliance's chief Jens Stoltenberg says.

The redesigned space was the scene of a flurry of activity on Friday, Turkey’s independence day: flower arrangements were hurriedly being taken inside while workers unrolled red carpets before the evening inauguration and the premiere of an opera commissioned for the occasion. Since the Republic of Turkey was founded a century ago, Taksim Square has functioned as a cultural and political hub. A massive new mosque on the opposite side of Taksim, long one of the pious Turkish leader’s pet projects, was completed earlier this year, giving an area long associated with the republic’s secular founding principles a new religious identity. The reopening of the cultural centre is seen by many in Turkey’s highly polarised society as restoring an ideological balance in an important public space. The long-awaited renovation should also be celebrated as the return of a cultural lodestar, said Gülper Refiğ, a musicology professor and longstanding figure in Turkey’s performing arts scene. “Atatürk commissioned the first Turkish opera, by Adnan Saygun in 1934, and the new one is commissioned by the president and written by one of Saygun’s students, Hasan Uçarsu, a very talented composer.” Uçarsu’s two-act opera focuses on one of the greatest artists in Ottoman history, Mimar Sinan, a prolific 16th-century architect who built Istanbul’s breathtaking Süleymaniye mosque and Edirne’s Selimiye mosque for the ruling sultans. As Turkey’s tourism industry struggles to recover from the pandemic, the municipality and the national culture ministry are seeking to cement Istanbul’s reputation as a global arts destination. The Contemporary Istanbul art fair has just successfully staged the city’s first international art event since before the Covid-19 shutdowns, and several new initiatives are on the way. Derelict shipyards on the Golden Horn are being transformed into a cultural quarter, and the new Galataport development on the Bosphorus will eventually house the new Renzo Piano-designed Istanbul Museum of Modern Art and the rehomed National Museum of Painting and Sculpture.","Atatürk cultural centre reopens in boost to Istanbul’s arts scene Istanbul’s Atatürk cultural centre has opened its doors for the first time in 13 years, breathing new life into the city’s arts scene.

The long-awaited renovation should also be celebrated as the return of a cultural lodestar, said Gülper Refiğ, a musicology professor and longstanding figure in Turkey’s performing arts scene. “Atatürk commissioned the first Turkish opera, by Adnan Saygun in 1934, and the new one is commissioned by the president and written by one of Saygun’s students, Hasan Uçarsu, a very talented composer.” Uçarsu’s two-act opera focuses on one of the greatest artists in Ottoman history, Mimar Sinan, a prolific 16th-century architect who built Istanbul’s breathtaking Süleymaniye mosque and Edirne’s Selimiye mosque for the ruling sultans. As Turkey’s tourism industry struggles to recover from the pandemic, the municipality and the national culture ministry are seeking to cement Istanbul’s reputation as a global arts destination. The Contemporary Istanbul art fair has just successfully staged the city’s first international art event since before the Covid-19 shutdowns, and several new initiatives are on the way. Derelict shipyards on the Golden Horn are being transformed into a cultural quarter, and the new Galataport development on the Bosphorus will eventually house the new Renzo Piano-designed Istanbul Museum of Modern Art and the rehomed National Museum of Painting and Sculpture.",POSITIVE,0.9950786828994752,Atatürk kültür merkezi İstanbul'un sanat sahnesine yeniden açılıyor,"İstanbul'un Atatürk kültür merkezi 13 yıl içinde ilk kez kapılarını açmış, yeni bir camiye yeni bir hayat kazandırmış, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, Türkiye'nin bağımsızlık gününe kavuşmuş, Türkiye'ye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş, camiye kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuş, yeni bir camiye kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuş bir mese kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuş bir camiye kavuşmuştur."

With a crowd of more than 30,000 in Azerbaijan's capital city effectively making this a home game for Turkey, Wales responded to the hostile atmosphere with a vibrant, attacking display in which they cut their opponents open at will. After a host of missed chances in a breathless first half, Gareth Bale played a brilliant lofted pass through the heart of the Turkish defence for Aaron Ramsey, who brought the ball down and finished elegantly. Although Turkey came back strongly, Wales squandered a glorious opportunity to consolidate their lead when captain Bale ballooned a penalty over the bar. There were some nervous moments for the Welsh defence as they withstood Turkish attacks - with Danny Ward making a vital late save to deny Merih Demiral. Relive the action from Wales v Turkey, plus reaction But regardless of events in Rome, this impressive performance and result against Turkey - tipped by many before this tournament as potential dark horses - marked a remarkable transformation from Robert Page's side. With Bale swapping wings with Daniel James, an absolute menace for the Turkish defence, there was a purpose and pace to Wales' game which had been lacking in their opening fixture. Bale picked up possession near halfway, saw Ramsey's run in behind Turkey's defence and found his team-mate with an expertly measured chip. Fortunate not to be further behind but willed on by a vociferous, overwhelmingly Turkish-Azeri crowd, Turkey were set up in a far more attacking manner for the second half with full-backs and wingers pushing further upfield. That was one of several Turkish efforts in a period of intense pressure and, having withstood it, Wales were presented with a gift of a chance to extend their lead. Bale took on Mehmet Zeki Celik inside the penalty area and, as the Turkey right-back dangled his leg, pushed the ball ahead of him and was taken down. Turkey were not done yet - Demiral's powerful header was well saved by Ward with just three minutes left - but it was Wales who had the final say.","Wales take huge step with Turkey win Wales took a significant stride towards qualifying for the second round of Euro 2020 as they overcame Turkey after a gripping encounter in Baku.

Athens, Greece – So-called earthquake diplomacy is a potential opportunity for Ankara and Athens to mend fences after elections in both countries this month. That seems to be the prevailing theory in the US State Department, after earthquakes in February killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and left 1.5 million homeless. Greece was the first country to send emergency assistance and extraction teams to Turkey, and the foreign and defence ministers of both countries have since met and proclaimed improved relations. After expressing his condolences for a rail disaster in late February that killed 57 people in Greece, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan restated Ankara’s disputes about Greek sovereignty over the east Aegean islands. Last year, Erdogan’s junior coalition partner caused a stir when he published a map depicting some islands as Turkish. His defence minister, Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos, said their publication was a sign of the fact that “long-term Turkish goals don’t change”. Nonetheless, there is a persistent rumour that after Turkey’s May 14 elections and Greece’s May 21 vote, the US will encourage Germany to undertake a diplomatic initiative to get Greek-Turkish talks going.

The Turkish Ministry of Trade said on Tuesday it will no longer send to Israel items in 54 categories spanning iron and steel products, jet fuel, construction equipment, machines, cement, granites, chemicals, pesticides and bricks. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz hit back at Turkey’s announcement saying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is “once again sacrificing the economic interests of the people of Turkey for his support of the Hamas murderers in Gaza”. He added Israel would take “measures that will harm the Turkish economy”, including banning some Turkish imports, asking United States-based organisations to stop investing in Turkey, and calling “our friends in the American Congress” to impose sanctions on Turkey. The announcement of the trade curbs came a day after Turkey promised “step by step” reprisals against Israel after it blocked Turkish cargo military planes from dropping aid over Gaza. “We will continue our support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters until the bloodshed in Gaza stops and they live in a free Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the basis of the 1967 borders,” Erdogan said on Tuesday, adding that Turkey has sent 45,000 tons of humanitarian aid to the region. Israel and Turkey pulled back their ambassadors from their respective capitals shortly after the start of the war. The two countries have been in a war of words since, with Erdogan calling Israel a “terror state”, emphasising Turkish support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and condemning Israel’s decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territory during a hearing at the International Court of Justice. But Ankara had not imposed any actual measures against Israel until Tuesday, with trades falling since October 7 but experts increasing each month this year so far, according to data published by the Turkish Exporters Assembly. The Turkish government has faced domestic criticism over its commercial ties to Israel during the war, something that was seen by many as a factor contributing to a major defeat in local elections at the end of March.","Turkey restricts exports of 54 products to Israel until Gaza ceasefire Turkey says it will impose restrictions on exports to Israel until there is a ceasefire and increased aid in the Gaza Strip after the Israeli government refused to allow it to airdrop aid over the besieged and bombarded territory.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/18/cyprus-seeks-to-revive-peace-talks-with-turkey,Cyprus seeks to revive peace talks with Turkey over divided island,18 Jul 2023 15.28 CEST,"Ankara’s recent interest in improving EU access seen as window of opportunity to restart diplomatic process Cypriot diplomats are seeking to revive peace talks on the divided island with proposed appointments of UN and EU envoys in a bid to find a federal solution five decades after occupation of the north of the island by Turkish troops. A small window of diplomatic opportunity may have opened due to Turkey’s recent interest in negotiating its relations with the European Union, especially on visa-free travel and the customs union. Cyprus – a former British colony – has been split since Ankara sent in troops in 1974, seizing its northern third in response to a coup orchestrated by the junta then in power in Athens aimed at uniting the country with Greece. However, the recent completion of elections in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus gives politicians greater room for manoeuvre if they wish to revive talks after a poorly prepared UN-led conference in Switerzland failed in 2017. Since then Turkey has become even more committed to a two-state solution for the island, but Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus (the self-styled “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”) is recognised only by Turkey, leaving it dependent on Ankara both economically and in terms of security. There are up to 30,000 Turkish troops on the island. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is due to visit the island on Thursday to mark the occupation and to open a new airport in the north. Some argue that Turkey’s desire to reopen talks on its relationship with the EU might give Brussels some leverage to persuade Erdoğan to re-examine a Cyprus strategy that is probably draining Ankara of badly needed funds. To Washington’s relief, Erdoğan has in principle lifted his veto on Sweden joining Nato, but appears to be waiting on confirmation from Washington that the US Senate is willing to supply F-16 jets to Turkey. He wants written undertakings that Turkey will not use the F-16s to continue overflights of Greek islands, creating an elaborate piece of choreography that affects not only Turkey, Sweden and Nato, but also Cyprus. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is due to address the EU foreign affairs council where he is likely to update EU foreign ministers on US relations with Turkey. Ersin Tatar, the elected Turkish Cypriot leader, has opposed unifying the island and wants the north of Cyprus to be recognised as an independent country.","Cyprus seeks to revive peace talks with Turkey over divided island Ankara’s recent interest in improving EU access seen as window of opportunity to restart diplomatic process Cypriot diplomats are seeking to revive peace talks on the divided island with proposed appointments of UN and EU envoys in a bid to find a federal solution five decades after occupation of the north of the island by Turkish troops.

Speaking to reporters in Istanbul on Monday ahead of his departure for a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Erdogan said Turkey has never “shut the door” to discussions with the Syrian government. Turkey has been the biggest military and political ally of the Syrian opposition, which controls the last rebel-held bastion in the country, which is in northwest Syria on the Turkish border. Ankara has set up dozens of bases and deployed thousands of troops in northern Syria, preventing the Russian-backed Syrian army from re-taking the region. Turkey has also been a base for Syrian opposition groups since 2011. However, Damascus’s condition of a complete withdrawal of Turkish forces for such a meeting is “unacceptable”, he said. Erdogan first said this year that he might meet al-Assad as part of a new peace process, but al-Assad said in March that there was no point in a meeting with Erdogan until Turkey’s “illegal occupation” ended. Turkey has said its military operations in Syria have been necessary to secure its southern border. It is trying to remove fighters with the YPG, the Kurdish People’s Defence Units, which Ankara has said is the Syrian branch of the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. The PKK has fought a war against the Turkish state since 1984 – a conflict that has led to tens of thousands of deaths. The defence ministers of Turkey and Syria met late last year for the highest level talks between the two neighbours since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings plunged Syria into war and put it and Turkey at odds. The foreign ministers of the two countries also met in Moscow in May ahead of Turkish elections as part of talks overseen by Russia. The restoration of ties with Damascus quickened its pace after the deadly February 6 earthquakes in southern Turkey and northwestern Syria and the Chinese-brokered re-establishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had backed opposing sides in the Syrian conflict.","Erdogan open to meeting al-Assad but not to withdrawal from Syria Turkey has been the biggest military and political ally of the Syrian opposition in the war-torn country’s northwest.

Northern Cyprus is a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey, and its Turkish Cypriot leadership wants international recognition. Erdogan attended a military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkey launched its offensive.

An attempt by Randa Fahmy, legal counsel to Elatr, to secure the devices from the Turkish embassy in Washington failed last year, with officials insisting that she would need to make a legal application in Turkey. Pressure is, however, being put on the White House to intervene following the decision by a Turkish court to suspend a trial in absentia of 26 Saudis accused of the killing, ahead of it being transferred to Saudi Arabia. She said: “As UN special rapporteur investigating the Saudi state murder of Jamal Khashoggi, I was aware from the very first days that the Turkish authorities were holding Jamal’s phones and his computer as part of their investigation. “I was hoping that during the trial in Turkey, the prosecutor will reveal information they had collected on Jamal’s phones or computer. But as we know this sadly did not happen and the trial in Turkey has now been brought to an abrupt end. Callamard, who is now the secretary general of Amnesty International, added: “I have been informed of the efforts of Hanan Elatr Khashoggi to secure these items from the Turkish authorities. “The Turkish government has been clear that it does not intend to proceed with the investigation and the trial.",NEGATIVE,0.9989941716194152,Jamal Khashoggi'nin eşi NSO Group'u Pegasus casus yazılımı nedeniyle dava etti,"Elatr, siyasi sığınma başvurusunda bulunduğu ABD'de bulunan Türk savcısı Elaş'ın, Türkiye'nin davada yardımcı olması için Türk makamlarının elinde olduğuna inanılan bir Türk yetkilisine el koymadığı yönündeki davada Türk savcısının bu davaya el koymadığını, Elaş'ın davaya el koymadığını, Türk savcısının davaya yardım etmek için Türk yetkililerine el koymadığını, Elatr'ın da davaya el koymadığını söylediğini ifade etti. 2018 yılının Ekim ayında İstanbul'daki Suudi konsoloslukta öldürüldü ve diğer cihazlara ela ela ela ait ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela ela el koydu."

Scientists who talked to Al Jazeera said a major temblor is highly likely to strike Turkey’s largest city as the nation mourns the deaths of tens of thousands of people in the country’s southeast a week ago. The twin tremors affected 10 provinces in Turkey and killed thousands of others in Syria, and the death toll continues to rise in both countries. The massive disaster raised the question of earthquake preparedness in Istanbul, Turkey’s business and tourism capital hosting some 16 million people. Sukru Ersoy, a professor of geology at Turkey’s Yildiz Technical University, said historical data of past earthquakes suggests that one on the fault line under the Marmara Sea is near. Huseyin Alan, chairman of the Chamber of Geological Engineers, agreed: “A magnitude 7.0 or higher earthquake is expected in Istanbul according to the data we have.” A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the western part of Turkey’s Marmara region in August 1999 and killed at least 17,500 people.

Turkey’s elections on May 14 are attracting significant international attention, with major media outlets dubbing them “the most important elections of 2023”. Many in the West seem to hope the Turks will finally replace President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) with a more accommodating liberal leadership that will bring about a profound change in the country’s domestic and international policies. In the West, the Turkish president has been described as “the other Putin”, a populist, divisive autocrat determined to pursue his dream of empire. Predictably, such characterisations have been condemned by Turkey’s pro-Erdogan media and ridiculed as arrogant and fanciful. He has, therefore, used the levers of the state to his advantage, making big announcements on the eve of the elections about Turkey’s forthcoming fortunes. He will continue to pursue a hybrid approach towards major powers by balancing Turkish interests with the West and Russia. He will maintain Turkey’s membership in NATO while strengthening trade and geopolitical relations with Russia. Kilicdaroglu, on the other hand, may be inclined to reverse some of his predecessor’s domestic political and economic policies and undo some of the illiberal measures enacted since Turkey’s 2016 failed coup in favour of greater institutionalism. But judging by the historic record, leaders in Turkey and elsewhere tend to keep executive powers and privileges they inherit from their predecessors. If elected, he is likely to soften Turkey’s tone towards its Western and NATO partners and remove its veto on Sweden’s membership in the military alliance.

With former Erdogan ally and strategist Ahmet Davutoglu now on his side, Kilicdaroglu is likely to maintain Turkey’s active regional and international posture, which, despite some setbacks, has served the country’s economic and geopolitical interests.","Turkish elections, Western illusions Win or lose, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s legacy will endure. Turkey’s elections on May 14 are attracting significant international attention, with major media outlets dubbing them “the most important elections of 2023”. Many in the West seem to hope the Turks will finally replace President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) with a more accommodating liberal leadership that will bring about a profound change in the country’s domestic and international policies. In the West, the Turkish president has been described as “the other Putin”, a populist, divisive autocrat determined to pursue his dream of empire. Predictably, such characterisations have been condemned by Turkey’s pro-Erdogan media and ridiculed as arrogant and fanciful. He has, therefore, used the levers of the state to his advantage, making big announcements on the eve of the elections about Turkey’s forthcoming fortunes. He will continue to pursue a hybrid approach towards major powers by balancing Turkish interests with the West and Russia. He will maintain Turkey’s membership in NATO while strengthening trade and geopolitical relations with Russia. Kilicdaroglu, on the other hand, may be inclined to reverse some of his predecessor’s domestic political and economic policies and undo some of the illiberal measures enacted since Turkey’s 2016 failed coup in favour of greater institutionalism. But judging by the historic record, leaders in Turkey and elsewhere tend to keep executive powers and privileges they inherit from their predecessors. If elected, he is likely to soften Turkey’s tone towards its Western and NATO partners and remove its veto on Sweden’s membership in the military alliance. But it is doubtful that he would sacrifice Ankara’s lucrative economic and energy relationship with Moscow – especially as bilateral trade reached $70bn last year – to satisfy the West.

With nearly 99.5% of ballot boxes opened, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has received 49.4% of votes his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu 44.96%, Turkey’s elections council YSK has said. Kılıçdaroğlu outperformed Erdoğan in around 30 constituencies in the presidential election, primarily those in areas where the opposition candidate’s CHP party already enjoys significant popularity, such as the more liberal Aegean coast, the southern regions of the country, and Turkish Thrace in the far west. Notably, Kılıçdaroğlu garnered a substantial share of the vote in southeast Turkey, which comprises provinces with a predominantly Kurdish population and where the left-wing Yesil Sol party secured the majority of parliamentary seats. Though the Kurdish vote was touted as the determining factor in this election – and the results do suggest it remains a crucial part of Kılıçdaroğlu’s electoral coalition – the opposition alliance will still need to gain more voters on the Turkish right to get Kılıçdaroğlu over 50% in a second round. Excluding the country’s three largest cities of Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara, however, Erdoğan appears to have got a consistently larger share than Kılıçdaroğlu throughout Anatolia in a total of 51 provinces, including the cities of Bursa and Konya (where he would have expected to win). The Turkish lira is on a two-month low, its sovereign dollar bonds have tumbled and the cost of insuring exposure to the country’s debt has climbed sharply as investors digest a presidential election apparently headed for a runoff with the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the lead. Reuters reports that Turkish bank shares were also hit hard, with the country’s main banking index falling by more than 8%.

Istanbul, Turkey – A nondescript apartment in Istanbul’s business district is the nerve centre of a drive to propel more women into Turkish politics. However, due to the nature of the election process – votes for parties are allocated to candidates according to their placement on ranked party lists – just four stand any real hope of entering the Turkish Grand National Assembly. The Workers’ Party of Turkey (TIP) is fielding the highest proportion of female candidates at 40.5 percent. The CHP has women ranked first on its list in just 11 of Turkey’s 87 electoral districts, while the AKP has four. The underrepresentation of women in national legislatures is not a situation unique to Turkey. Turkey comes 132nd in the world, with 17.4 percent of the deputies elected in 2018 being women. Some have pointed to patriarchal societies as the main barrier to women becoming involved in politics, but evidence in Turkey suggests such attitudes have eased significantly. In research carried out by Ben Secerim and the polling firm KONDA last year, 62 percent of respondents said that female politicians would help Turkey develop and become a better society. Turkish women have long been at the forefront of campaigning on social issues. Turkey’s 2021 withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention on protecting women against violence increased civil activists’ fears. A government statement at the time said: “The decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention in no way means that the State of the Republic of Türkiye ‘compromised to protect women’.

The Iraqi demand on Saturday came as a Turkish Defence Ministry official told the Reuters news agency that no Turkish Armed Forces operation had taken place in that region in recent days. It said Ankara had no legal justification to continue “intimidating civilians under the pretext that forces hostile to it are present on Iraqi soil”. “In this regard, we call on the Turkish government to take responsibility and present an official apology,” it said. Turkey, which has spent decades fighting Kurdish armed groups in its east, has conducted several military operations including air raids in northern Iraq and northern Syria against Kurdish-led forces there. Ankara views the Kurdish-led forces as “terrorists” allied with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK. Asked about the reason behind the attack, Abdi said, “It is a clear message from the Turks that they are bothered and oppose our international relations and they want to damage them.” Abdi added that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was looking for a “free victory” ahead of the country’s parliamentary and presidential elections next month. He noted that the attack came days after Turkey closed its airspace to aircraft travelling to and from Sulaimaniyah due to what it said was intensified activity by PKK fighters, and said the shelling had escalated tensions between the main parties in the Iraqi Kurdish government. Ankara has close ties to the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which is the largest party in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region and is dominant in the regional capital, Erbil. “This tense atmosphere between the two sides of the Kurdish Regional Government comes at a time when the airspace in Turkey remains closed to flights coming from Sulaimaniyah airport, and at a time when many say the differences between both parties of the government should come to an end ….","Iraq demands Turkey apologise over airport attack The Iraqi government has called on Turkey to apologise for an attack on an airport in the country’s northern Kurdish region, while a US official confirmed there had been an attack on a convoy with US military personnel in the area but said there were no casualties.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who visited Turkey last month, said the partnership was backed by some funding but he would not say how much, telling GB News it was ""not primarily about money"" but sharing information. The government said the new centre of excellence, which will be established by the Turkish National Police, would help the two countries share intelligence so staff could act more quickly on information. It said more officers would also be deployed to Turkey to enable collaboration between National Crime Agency and Home Office staff based in the country and their Turkish counterparts.

The leaders met in in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi for Wednesday’s summit, in which Erdoğan sought to shore up a March 2020 ceasefire deal which ended a bruising assault by Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies on Turkish-backed fighters in north-west Syria. The fighting last year brought Ankara and Moscow close to direct confrontation and threatened Turkey – which is already home to about 4 million Syrians – with a new wave of refugees. Ahead of this week’s summit, first responders in the Idlib area said Syrian air force bombing has again intensified, and the Turkish military has deployed extra troops to the region as a deterrent. The peace there is dependent on Turkey-Russia ties,” Erdoğan said at the start of Wednesday’s talks. Putin, who made only a passing reference to Syria in his opening comments, said that “negotiations with Turkey are sometimes difficult” but that the two countries had learned “how to find compromises that are beneficial to both sides”. The relationship between the regional powers is awkward, but the two countries have grown closer in recent years as tensions with the west have built in both Moscow and Ankara. While they back opposing sides in wars across the Middle East and the Caucasus, Turkey and Russia enjoy strong trade and energy links, and millions of Russian tourists who visit Turkey every year represent a significant source of hard currency for the struggling Turkish economy. Turkey is also understood to have pressed on Wednesday for Russian help in removing western-backed Syrian Kurdish forces on its border, and last week signalled it is open to acquiring more Russian-made military hardware. Ankara’s 2019 delivery of the S-400 air defence system from Russia alarmed Nato allies, triggered US sanctions and led to Turkey’s removal from the F-35 fighter jet programme.","Erdoğan and Putin hold face-to-face talks over Syria ceasefire Turkey’s president wants to shore up the truce because it has been ruptured repeatedly in the last 18 months The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for their first face-to-face talks since the pandemic in which they discussed the future of the last pocket of Syria outside regime control.

Putin, who made only a passing reference to Syria in his opening comments, said that “negotiations with Turkey are sometimes difficult” but that the two countries had learned “how to find compromises that are beneficial to both sides”. The relationship between the regional powers is awkward, but the two countries have grown closer in recent years as tensions with the west have built in both Moscow and Ankara. While they back opposing sides in wars across the Middle East and the Caucasus, Turkey and Russia enjoy strong trade and energy links, and millions of Russian tourists who visit Turkey every year represent a significant source of hard currency for the struggling Turkish economy. Turkey is also understood to have pressed on Wednesday for Russian help in removing western-backed Syrian Kurdish forces on its border, and last week signalled it is open to acquiring more Russian-made military hardware. Ankara’s 2019 delivery of the S-400 air defence system from Russia alarmed Nato allies, triggered US sanctions and led to Turkey’s removal from the F-35 fighter jet programme.",POSITIVE,0.7235202193260193,Erdoğan ve Putin Suriye ateşkesi konusunda yüz yüze görüşmelerde bulundu,"Türkiye cumhurbaşkanı ateşkesi desteklemek istiyor, çünkü son 18 ayda defalarca koptu.

The opposition’s victory, pushing aside Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party in most of Turkey’s major cities and particularly in Istanbul, cemented Imamoğlu’s role as the primary opposition challenger to Erdoğan, who formerly held the role of Istanbul mayor decades ago and made no secret of his desire to bring Istanbul back under his control.

Both have led Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and home to about a third of its economy, and both have faced pushback from Turkey’s courts. Selim Sazak, the head of Sanda Global, an Ankara-based consultancy that advised several campaigns during the local elections, described Imamoğlu’s political brand as a blend of charisma and his Black Sea roots as “Bill Clinton from Trabzon … without the infidelity.” Despite their similarities, Erdoğan’s distaste for the Istanbul mayor transformed him from a political upstart into a rising star, when in 2019 the Turkish president demanded a re-run of the ballot from Imamoğlu’s initial win. While Imamoğlu has frequently described obstacles from Ankara stymying his ability to deliver on his promises to Istanbulites, he found success in a campaign centred on repelling Erdoğan’s bid to put the central government in the capital back in control of Istanbul, a city of 16 million people.","Ekrem Imamoğlu, the Istanbul mayor emerging as likely challenger to Erdoğan Affable opposition leader has same roots as Turkish president, but says ‘our ideas are largely opposite’ Speaking to his supporters after a night of historic wins for his opposition Republican People’s party, the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoğlu, was quick to meet the moment, calling it “the dawn of a new era”. “We are taking the first step towards a Turkey where democracy, freedom, equality, rationality, science, love, and solidarity flourish,” he told the ecstatic crowd, buoyed by a night of unexpected results in which the CHP swept municipalities nationwide, its best result since 1977.

Bab al-Hawa, Syria – After seven years apart, Hussein al-Ahmed made the journey from Turkey, and finally reunited with his family in northern Syria. Instead, al-Ahmed is one of the thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey who have taken advantage of a relaxation in regulations following the devastating earthquakes that hit southeastern Turkey and northern Syria a month ago. Turkish authorities now allow Syrian refugees residing in earthquake-hit provinces to voluntarily return to opposition-controlled northwestern Syria and then come back – as long as they do not spend longer than six months away. For Syrians living in the 10 Turkish provinces most deeply affected by the earthquakes, where so many buildings have been destroyed and many remain unsafe, Syria – a country they fled due to the now 12-year war – suddenly looks more appealing, albeit temporarily. “After my sister and I spent 10 days in public parks, I did not have any choice other than return to Syria through the voluntary return system that was announced,” said al-Ahmed, a 30-year-old refugee originally from northern rural Hama who lives in the city of Iskenderun in southern Turkey. The desperate condition of the southern Turkish provinces hit by the earthquakes, and the lack of relatives in other provinces, are among the pull factors that have encouraged some Syrians to make the journey to northern Syria. There, they have relatives and may be able to at least secure a shelter before again considering whether to stay or to return to Turkey, once earthquake-hit areas have been rebuilt. “The number of refugees arriving through the Bab al-Hawa crossing is nearly 15,000,” Mazen Alloush, director of media relations on the Syrian side of the crossing between the country and Turkey, told Al Jazeera.

A Turkish defence ministry official also told Reuters last week that 40,000 Syrians had returned to their home country. Since April last year, Syrians had been prevented from making round trips back to Syria, and were not allowed to return to Turkey if they crossed the border.","After earthquakes, Syrians utilise new rules to cross from Turkey Thousands of Syrians have decided to rely on support networks in their home country after earthquakes devastated their homes in Turkey.

Istanbul, Turkey – The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly direct in their criticism of Israel. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv’s “unconciliatory” policy, which included Israel’s decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital.","Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into ‘deep freezer’ Turkey’s forthright support for Palestine could affecting efforts to revive ties with Israel.

Reporting from Istanbul Fethullah Gulen, the preacher who founded an international Islamic movement and was a major ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey before being accused of plotting a coup against him in 2016, has died. During his own rise as an Islamist politician in a staunchly secular country, Mr. Erdogan found useful allies in Mr. Gulen’s followers, who also used Islam as their guide in the prominent positions they held in Turkey’s judiciary, police forces and news media. But the two men later became enemies, and in 2016 the Turkish government designated Mr. Gulen’s movement a terrorist organization. Nearly a decade after the failed coup and more than two decades since he left Turkey for the United States, Mr. Gulen’s image still loomed large as a key irritant in U.S.-Turkey relations and for Mr. Erdogan, who wanted the cleric sent back to Turkey to stand trial. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, on Monday confirmed Mr. Gulen’s death, calling him the leader of a “dark organization.” Suggesting that Mr. Gulen’s movement still posed a threat to Turkey, Mr. Fidan urged its followers to cut ties. Mr. Gulen began his career as a provincial preacher in Turkey but gradually amassed a large following that grew into an international movement called Hizmet, or “service,” in Turkish. At its height, Hizmet ran schools in Turkey, Central Asia, Africa and elsewhere and promoted a vision of Islam that was friendly to the West and supported free markets, science and interfaith dialogue.

It was a moment preceded days before by the arrival in the Syrian capital of Turkey’s spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin. Dareen Khalifa of the non-profit International Crisis Group describes Kalin’s visit to the Syrian capital as “a victory lap,” with Ankara emerging as a major beneficiary from the new government in Damascus. The toppling of Assad has vindicated Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s approach on Syria at home in Turkey, granted Ankara new opportunities in a power struggle across Kurdish areas in the north-east and afforded it fresh influence as Syria rebuilds. “Relations between HTS and Turkey shouldn’t be overestimated, it’s not a proxy relationship, but Turkey was smart to wait until things were settled and then go in full force with Kalin’s visit and other senior people as well,” says Khalifa. Ankara had for months stalled HTS and delayed the launch of the group’s offensive, analysts said, and instead attempted to use a meeting with Russian and Iranian officials in early November in the hope of finally bringing Assad to the negotiating table. Turkey appealed to Assad’s Russian allies, Khalifa believes, asking Moscow to speak to the Syrian leader and stop the strikes, with little result. By the time Sharaa, who was formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, approached Ankara later in November, notifying them that his forces were ready to launch an offensive, they relented because of Moscow’s inability to stop Assad. “Ultimately Turkey said OK, teach them a lesson, but Ankara didn’t realise that HTS would seize Aleppo, let alone the entire country,” Khalifa says. Ankara knew what kind of manoeuvre that HTS might pull, that they would give the impression they were going in one direction, east, when actually they wanted to go south.","‘Ankara is getting what it wants’: how Erdoğan’s balancing act in Syria paid off Turkey tried to stall the HTS rebels’ offensive but has now become Syria’s ‘gateway to the outside world’ Less than a week after the deposed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, Turkish officials raised their flag over the embassy in Damascus.

Detained in 2016, Selahattin Demirtas was then jailed in September 2018 for four years and eight months for making and ""spreading terrorist propaganda"" for militants fighting the Turkish state. Demirtas was co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which in 2015 became the first pro-Kurdish party to enter Turkey's parliament by surpassing the required 10% of the vote. As joint leader of the left-wing party, Demirtas played a key role in extending its reach beyond Kurdish voters and attracting mainstream voters in western Turkey. But after a ceasefire broke down in 2015 between Turkey and the militant PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party], there was spate of attacks and Demirtas and several colleagues were then charged with links to the outlawed group. In its ruling, the European Court of Human Rights found that by detaining Demirtas Turkey had ""pursued the ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate"". It found no clear link between his speeches and terrorism offences and ruled that Turkey should take immediate measures to release him. Turkey's justification for his pre-trial detention had ""merely been cover for an ulterior political purpose, which was a matter of indisputable gravity for democracy"", it added. In a speech to his AK party in parliament, the Turkish president said the ECHR had defended a ""terrorist"" and only Turkish courts could rule on the Demirtas case. Meanwhile, in a separate Turkish court verdict on Wednesday, exiled journalist Can Dundar was given a 27-year jail term in absentia for aiding a terrorist organisation and espionage.

Gulsin Harman and Ben Hubbard reported from Istanbul, and Aaron Boxerman from Jerusalem. Turkey said on Friday that it would suspend all trade with Israel until there was a “permanent cease-fire” in the Gaza Strip, the latest international sanction against Israel and one that underscores the mounting global pressure to end the war in the territory. Turkey’s announcement built on statements the previous day that it had halted all trade with Israel until “uninterrupted and adequate humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza.” But even as Turkey announced the measures, Israel continued its repeated warnings that it was preparing for an offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that the United Nations said on Friday could result in a “slaughter” in Gaza. In announcing the trade suspension, the Turkish trade minister, Omer Bolat, spoke of Israel’s “uncompromising attitude.” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told a business association on Friday that he anticipated backlash from Western countries but that Turkey had decided to “stand side by side with the persecuted.” “This is how a dictator behaves, disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen, and ignoring international trade agreements,” Mr. Katz said in a social media post.

Turkey said on Friday that it would suspend all trade with Israel until there was a “permanent cease-fire” in the Gaza Strip, the latest international sanction against Israel and one that underscores the mounting global pressure to end the war in the territory. Turkey’s announcement built on statements the previous day that it had halted all trade with Israel until “uninterrupted and adequate humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza.” But even as Turkey announced the measures, Israel continued its repeated warnings that it was preparing for an offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that the United Nations said on Friday could result in a “slaughter” in Gaza. In announcing the trade suspension, the Turkish trade minister, Omer Bolat, spoke of Israel’s “uncompromising attitude.” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, told a business association on Friday that he anticipated backlash from Western countries but that Turkey had decided to “stand side by side with the persecuted.” “This is how a dictator behaves, disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen, and ignoring international trade agreements,” Mr. Katz said in a social media post.

The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey have agreed to revive high-level contacts between their countries and seek “new approaches” to problems as part of an effort to improve ties between the two NATO neighbours, who have been at loggerheads over a string of decades-old disputes. Discussions between Greece’s Giorgos Gerapetritis and Turkey’s Hakan Fidan on Tuesday were held in a relatively friendly climate triggered by Greece sending assistance to Turkey following a devastating earthquake earlier this year and Turkey offering condolences after a deadly train accident in Greece. The meeting came as Ankara, in the throes of an economic downturn, is seeking a reset of its often-troubled relations with Western nations. Greece and Turkey are at odds over territorial claims in the Aegean Sea, energy exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean and the division of Cyprus, among other issues.

With 99.43% of the vote counted, Turkey’s supreme election authority announced late on Sunday that Erdoğan had won 52.14% of the votes, while Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%. Even before the result was called, a triumphant Erdoğan stood on top of a bus near his residence in Istanbul to once again sing a campaign song to his adherents and pronounce victory. The victory for Turkey’s longest-serving leader affords him both another term in office as president, and an endorsement of his populist style of politics after he emerged victorious in an election that challenged his rule. The Turkish leader has spent two decades reshaping the country in his own image, concentrating power on his office, detaining opponents and instituting increasingly unorthodox economic policies. Despite this, he gained support in many of the areas of Turkey worst hit by the country’s financial troubles, as well as areas levelled in twin deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in south-east Turkey. “We are not the only ones who have won, Turkey has won … our democracy has won,” Erdoğan later told his supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace. The Turkish president went on to boast of Turkey’s economic independence despite a financial crisis linked to his policies, one sparking a rising cost of living crisis among his citizens. At the headquarters of his Republican People’s party (CHP) in the Turkish capital, Kılıçdaroğlu attempted to console his supporters, but made no suggestion he could stand down as opposition leader. Kılıçdaroğlu and his opposition coalition campaigned on the promise of returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy, pledging to reverse many of the changes that have marked Erdoğan’s two decades of rule, including concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. While the opposition holds mayorships in Turkey’s six largest cities, Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign appeared to run aground outside his party’s traditional enclaves on the Aegean coast and in metropolitan centres.","Recep Tayyip Erdoğan wins Turkish presidential election Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has extended his two decades in power, securing victory over his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu after an unprecedented presidential runoff election, in a vote that reflected Turkey’s stark and persistent political polarisation.

Carrying out the expulsions would send Turkey’s relationships with Europe and the US to an all-time low, risk further turmoil for the Turkish lira, and accelerate Ankara’s drift away from the west. Seven of the countries involved are Turkey’s Nato allies. The ambassadors “cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders … I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done: these 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once,” Erdoğan said in a speech in the north-western city of Eskişehir. “They will know and understand Turkey. The day they do not know and understand Turkey, they will leave,” he said to cheers from the crowd. “No instructions have been given to embassies,” a Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters, adding that it was possible a decision may be taken at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Most of the countries involved have declined to comment until hearing from official Turkish channels, with the US state department saying Washington was aware of the reports and was seeking clarity from the Turkish foreign ministry. Kavala and eight other Gezi park activists facing up to 20 years in prison on terror charges were acquitted last year in a surprise ruling, but he was returned to Istanbul’s Silivri prison within hours after a new warrant for his re-arrest as part of an investigation into the failed 2016 coup. The Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey by the end of next month if Kavala is not released. Demonstrations that began over plans to turn the rare green space in central Istanbul into a shopping mall grew into nationwide protests against the then prime minister’s increasingly strong grip on Turkey. The UK has long prided itself on its close relations with Turkey, and was the first country to send a minister to Ankara after the 2016 abortive coup.

Here are five key takeaways from the results of Turkey’s vote: Erdogan was already Turkey’s longest-serving leader, but his election win extends his 20-year rule – he was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and then president – for a further five years. His influence on Turkey can now be rivalled only by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was president for 15 years, between 1923 and his death in 1938. Erdogan has been able to shape Turkish politics. In 2014, he became the first president elected by popular vote, going on to win a referendum that changed governance in Turkey to a presidential system. The political savvy that has contributed to his survival can perhaps be traced back to Erdogan’s younger days, and a career that began in the 1970s in Beyoglu, the Istanbul district that includes his childhood home in the working-class neighbourhood of Kasimpasa. He rose through the ranks, and in 1994, became mayor of Istanbul, where he addressed many of the problems facing the city’s rapidly growing population, such as air pollution, rubbish collection and a lack of clean water. But his rise led to a confrontation with the Turkish state, and even a period in prison and a political ban for publicly reading a politically-charged poem. For many supporters, particularly in Turkey’s Anatolian heartland and Black Sea region, he is the man who represents them – no matter what his critics say. And now many opposition politicians are looking to Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavas, the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, respectively, as future leaders. Looking at the electoral map in Turkey, it is clear that support for Kilicdaroglu came in Istanbul, Ankara and Turkey’s western Aegean coast, as well as the Kurdish-majority southeast. The president has lost support in recent years for a crackdown on the biggest pro-Kurdish party, the HDP, and military and security operations against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its affiliates in Turkey and beyond.","Five key takeaways from Turkey’s pivotal election Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has extended his leadership of Turkey into a third decade after he won re-election in a tense run-off.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65743475,Why Erdogan's victory matters for the West,29 May 2023,"You can spot Turkey's global strategic significance - which has starkly increased against the backdrop of the Ukraine war - by the A-list potpourri of world leaders who rushed to congratulate Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his election win on Sunday night. He was so keen to stroke the ego of his Turkish counterpart and fellow ""strongman"" leader that he didn't even wait for the official results of the vote before singling out Mr Erdogan's ""independent foreign policy"" as a reason for his victory. We can safely assume the Turkish policy that Russia is particularly fond of is Mr Erdogan's refusal to ostracise the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as Turkey's allies in Nato imposed sanctions and slashed their energy reliance on Russia. Trade between Turkey and Russia even increased significantly since the start of the war in Ukraine. Despite their dislike of Mr Erdogan's cosying up to the Kremlin and his slashing of free speech and democratic norms at home during his first two decades in power, to them Turkey is a crucial - if difficult and unpredictable - ally of the West. Turkey is a key member of the Nato military alliance, taking part in all its missions. Once a passionate advocate of Turkey joining the EU, Mr Erdogan these days speaks of ""making Turkey great again"".

He was so keen to stroke the ego of his Turkish counterpart and fellow ""strongman"" leader that he didn't even wait for the official results of the vote before singling out Mr Erdogan's ""independent foreign policy"" as a reason for his victory. We can safely assume the Turkish policy that Russia is particularly fond of is Mr Erdogan's refusal to ostracise the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as Turkey's allies in Nato imposed sanctions and slashed their energy reliance on Russia. Trade between Turkey and Russia even increased significantly since the start of the war in Ukraine. Despite their dislike of Mr Erdogan's cosying up to the Kremlin and his slashing of free speech and democratic norms at home during his first two decades in power, to them Turkey is a crucial - if difficult and unpredictable - ally of the West. Turkey is a key member of the Nato military alliance, taking part in all its missions. Once a passionate advocate of Turkey joining the EU, Mr Erdogan these days speaks of ""making Turkey great again"".

In what Greece’s migration ministry called “an unusual and special case”, the Turkish-flagged vessel was towed into the port of Kos on Sunday. Many were reported to be hungry and dehydrated after an ordeal that began on Thursday when the freighter, initially bound for Italy, developed engine trouble and sent out a distress signal off the island of Crete, shortly after setting sail from Turkey. Days of negotiations between Athens and Ankara followed after the Greek government appealed via the European Commission for Turkey to take the vessel back in line with a 2016 accord reached with the EU intended to staunch migrants flows. When the Turkish authorities made clear they would not be accepting the ship, Greek coastguard officials launched what they called one of the largest search and rescue operations in the eastern Mediterranean. The country’s minister for migration and asylum policy, Notis Mitarachi, described the incident as “another dangerous and illegal journey from the Turkish coast … facilitated by criminal gangs”. He said on Sunday: “We have notified the EU that Turkey has refused to take their vessel back. It is time for the EU to act and provide impactful solidarity and ensure the [2016] EU/Turkey statement is upheld. “Unlike Turkey and others that ignored the problem, Greece stepped up, providing immediate humanitarian support to people in need as we always do. Numbers have dropped precipitously but Athens and Ankara have been in a war of words over migrant arrivals. Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of forcibly returning boats crammed with asylum seekers into Turkish waters by pursuing a policy of pushbacks, and has invited the international media to witness such incidents. Athens has charged Turkish authorities with deliberately escalating tension by encouraging smugglers to organise the illicit journeys. None of those onboard wanted to return to Turkey because they did not consider it a safe country, the organisation said.","Greece lets boat packed with Afghan refugees dock after four days at sea After roaming the high seas for four days as Greece and Turkey haggled over its fate, a cargo ship packed with hundreds of Afghan refugees has been allowed to dock at an Aegean island, with passengers disembarking to apply for asylum.

He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks. “God willing, we will have the opportunity to assess to what much higher level we can take Turkey-Saudi Arabia relations,” Erdoğan said, announcing the sudden visit late last week.

Turkey’s high-stakes presidential election is headed for a run-off vote, Turkey’s electoral chief Ahmet Yener, has said, citing official results from the country’s Supreme Election Council. As neither secured more than 50 percent of the vote, they will face off in a second round on May 28, taking Turkey into uncharted territory. This is only the third time that Turks directly voted for a president, with Erdogan winning both previous elections outright in the first round. The Turkish news agency published preliminary results that showed AK Party won 266 seats, while the main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP) won 166 seats in the 600-seat parliament. The 2023 elections also took on extra significance merely due to the date – the year marks the centenary of the Republic of Turkey. The country’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk also established the Republican People’s Party (CHP), which governed under a largely one-party system for 27 years. Turkey’s elections had been billed as the most consequential since its first fair multi-party polls in 1950 – boiling down to a choice between five more years of Erdogan, Turkey’s most electorally successful politician, or a new direction under an old party that has reinvented itself in recent years. During a wearying campaign, Erdogan frequently spoke at multiple rallies in a day, highlighting the advances made in Turkey during his 20-year rule while simultaneously lambasting the opposition for supporting “terrorism” or being in thrall to the West. Kilicdaroglu, who has set the CHP on a more social democratic path since taking the helm of the party in 2010, was able to call on the support of alliance partners and the nationally recognised CHP mayors of Ankara and Istanbul to share the burden of public appearances. Both candidates made use of social media to get their messages across in a vote where nearly five million were casting their ballots for the first time, with Kilicdaroglu employing Twitter videos filmed at his home in Ankara.","Turkey’s presidential election goes to run-off: Election council No candidate secured more than 50 percent of the vote, pushing Turkey into a second round – and uncharted territory.

With Turkey’s Nato membership often under challenge, partly due to its decision to buy the Russian-made S-400 air-defence system, Erdoğan faces a difficult balancing act in showing continued strong diplomatic support for Ukraine while not damaging his complex long-term relations with Moscow. In a sign of the visit’s importance, Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, and Ibrahim Kalin, chief adviser to the president of Turkey, spoke on Tuesday about their commitment to “deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine”, according to a White House statement. Putin criticised Turkey last year when it sold its Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian army. The sale led to an official complaint from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Turkey was feeding militarist tendencies. Iliya Kuva from the Ukrainian Institute of the Future said: “The drones have a pretty huge psychological and political impact on Ukrainian public opinion since Turkey is seen as the country that provides weapons that are modern and good enough to maintain a military balance with Russian forces in the east.” On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians have been angered by TurkStream, a gas pipeline inaugurated in 2020. The pipeline takes gas from Russia to Turkey via the Black Sea in a manner that weakens Ukraine’s role as a transit country for Russian gas, in the same way that Nord Stream 2 will if Germany declares it has passed regulatory hurdles. In a bid to reassure Moscow before Erdoğan’s visit, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, stressed Ankara’s commitment to the 1936 Montreux Convention, the treaty that strictly restricts Nato forces’ access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus. The convention regulates maritime traffic through Turkey’s Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – the link between the Mediterranean and Black seas. During the confrontation in Georgia, Turkey refused to let US warships into the Black Sea as part of US moves to deter Russia. Turkey’s turbulent relations with Moscow in Libya and Syria show two countries often in direct conflict but not eager to see relations break down, let alone spill into direct military action.","Erdoğan offers to mediate between Ukraine and Russia Turkish president faces delicate balancing act in supporting Ukraine while maintaining Moscow relations The Turkish president and wild card of Nato diplomacy, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will fly to Kyiv on Thursday to offer himself again in the role of mediator between Ukraine and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.

With the setting sun reflecting in the water and the lights of Istanbul twinkling on the horizon, the wedding guests sat around lantern-lit tables: diplomats from several countries, military officers, journalists and activists who had flown in from around the world to see James Le Mesurier get married. The couple lived in a traditional white wooden house overlooking the Marmara Sea on Buyukada island, off the coast of Istanbul. On 11 November 2019 at around 05:00, a worshipper on his way to morning prayers discovered James Le Mesurier's crumpled body lying on the cobblestones in a narrow alleyway in Istanbul. Turkish detectives questioned her and took her DNA and fingerprints before forensically scouring the scene. So when, in 2011, he was invited by Alistair Harris to move to Turkey and manage civil society projects across the border in Syria, he jumped at the chance. As head of the Istanbul office of Harris's organisation, Ark, one of the projects Le Mesurier's took on focused on training young Syrians to act as firefighters, ambulance drivers and rescuers. He brought them all together in one organisation and got them professionally trained by the Turkish earthquake rescue specialists, Akut. While rescue operations were taking place in Syria, Le Mesurier was in Istanbul, hundreds of miles away. Le Mesurier returned to Istanbul utterly depleted. Months after his return to Istanbul his head of finance, a Dutchman named Johan Eleveld, asked where the remaining cash had gone. The couple spent the evening of 10 November in their flat above the Mayday Rescue offices in central Istanbul. In the end, the Turkish police concluded that James's death was suicide.","A man who tried to help Syria - and was crushed by disinfo The battle for truth formed a backdrop to James Le Mesurier's sudden death in Istanbul in November 2019.

Turkish detectives questioned her and took her DNA and fingerprints before forensically scouring the scene. So when, in 2011, he was invited by Alistair Harris to move to Turkey and manage civil society projects across the border in Syria, he jumped at the chance. As head of the Istanbul office of Harris's organisation, Ark, one of the projects Le Mesurier's took on focused on training young Syrians to act as firefighters, ambulance drivers and rescuers. He brought them all together in one organisation and got them professionally trained by the Turkish earthquake rescue specialists, Akut. While rescue operations were taking place in Syria, Le Mesurier was in Istanbul, hundreds of miles away. Le Mesurier returned to Istanbul utterly depleted. Months after his return to Istanbul his head of finance, a Dutchman named Johan Eleveld, asked where the remaining cash had gone. The couple spent the evening of 10 November in their flat above the Mayday Rescue offices in central Istanbul. In the end, the Turkish police concluded that James's death was suicide.",NEGATIVE,0.9941368103027344,Suriye'ye yardım etmeye çalışan bir adam - ve disinfo tarafından ezildi,"Doğruluk savaşı, Kasım 2019'da İstanbul'da James Le Mesurier'in ani ölümüne zemin oluşturdu.

The decision marks a partial shift in the unorthodox economic policy of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, under which interest rates have been frozen since March 2021 despite a sharp devaluation in the Turkish lira. Officially, inflation in Turkey is at 39.59%, although unofficial estimates from Turkey’s independent Inflation Research Group put it at 110%. “Today’s decision is insufficient to offset the weakening of the lira, and hence upwards risks in inflationary pressures are more likely to materialise,” said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koç University in Istanbul. A steeper rise in interest rates had been hotly anticipated following the return of Mehmet Şimşek, a former economist at the US embassy in Ankara and banker at Merrill Lynch and UBS, to the post of finance minister after Erdoğan’s re-election, as well as the recent appointment of the economist and banker Hafize Gaye Erkan to the post of central bank governor. Bloomberg economists estimated in May that Turkish authorities had spent $177bn (£138bn) propping up the lira since it crashed in December 2021. This week the Turkish vice-president, Cevdet Yılmaz, and Şimşek made a one-day visit to the United Arab Emirates before Erdoğan is due to visit. The two countries signed a $40bn trade agreement in March, ratified shortly after Erdoğan’s re-election, as part of deepening economic ties amid efforts by Erdoğan and other Turkish officials to attract Gulf investment amid a foreign currency shortage. In January last year, the Turkish central bank and its Emirati counterpart agreed a £3.8bn currency swap.","Turkish central bank raises interest rates to 15% after two-year freeze Turkey’s central bank has raised interest rates for the first time in more than two years, from 8.5% to 15%, but there is widespread concern that the move is insufficient to combat rising inflation and a continuing economic crisis.

The violent attack on elite referee Halil Umut Meler has left Turkish football in a full-blown crisis and magnified concerns about Turkey's institutions. The referee was treated in hospital after he was punched in the face by MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca, after the Ankara-based team conceded a late equaliser in the Turkish capital against Super Lig rivals Caykur Rizespor. The dramatic events after the final whistle underscore the intense emotions surrounding football in Turkey. The sport is massively popular in the country of 85 million people and is a platform that links Turkish politics, business and culture. The attack has prompted the 37-year old referee on Uefa's elite list to contemplate quitting, according to Ali Kunak, former general secretary of the Turkish Football Federation's central arbitration board, who spoke to Meler and local media on Tuesday. The violence has also led to an indefinite suspension of Turkish Super Lig games.
