BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vkxvk91gjo,Owner and architect of Turkey quake collapse hotel jailed,3 days ago,"A court in Turkey has sentenced the owner and architect of a hotel which collapsed in an earthquake in 2023, killing 72 people, to jail. The hotel, in the south-eastern city of Adiyaman, was hosting a school volleyball team from Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus and a group of tourist guides when the quake hit last February. Turkish Cypriot Prime Minister Unal Ustel said the sentences were too lenient and that authorities would appeal, AFP new agency reported. More than 50,000 people died in Turkey and Syria in the quake on 6 February 2023. The Turkish government said a few weeks later that hundreds of people were under investigation and nearly 200 people had been arrested, including construction contractors and property owners. A group of 39 people, including boys and girls, teachers and parents from Famagusta Turkish Education College, had travelled to Adiyaman for a volleyball tournament when the earthquake struck. The sheer scale of building collapses in the earthquake prompted widespread criticism of the Turkish government for encouraging a construction boom while failing to enforce building regulations, which had been tightened after earlier disasters."

Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the PKK - banned Kurdish separatists who have waged an insurgency for decades, and are classed as terrorists by the US, and the EU. Turkey has long wanted a 30km ""buffer zone"" in the Kurdish region in northeastern Syria. ""The number one threat is now Turkey because its airstrikes are killing our forces,"" said General Abdi. Some Kurdish civilians in the city of Al-Hasakah are doing the same - fearing a comeback by the jihadis and another ground offensive by Turkey in north-eastern Syria. This would be the fourth invasion by Turkish forces. The Turks are threatening us, and the doors are open for IS."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the ""historic agreement"", which he said would eventually ensure landlocked Ethiopia's access to the sea. Turkey has in recent years become an important geopolitical player in the Horn of Africa as it has close economic ties with Addis Ababa and security deals with Mogadishu.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd75e8gdy9jo,The global players in Syria before and after Assad,10 Dec 2024,"Those with a vested interest in the conflict and the future of the country include, on one side, Russia and Iran - which backed Assad - and on the other, the US and Turkey, which supported different rebel groups and militias. During Syria's civil war, Turkey has supported rebel factions - most of which now fight under the banner of the Syrian National Army (SNA) - by providing arms, military and political support. Syria's northern neighbour has mostly been concerned with using rebels to contain the Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey accuses of being an extension of a domestically banned Kurdish rebel group, the PKK. Turkey also wants the roughly three million Syrian refugees living in its country to return home. However, Turkish troops and allied rebels seized stretches of territory from the YPG and SDF along Syria's northern border. Turkey has also been politically involved. In 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib, the rebels' stronghold in the north-west. Many believe the offensive could not have happened without Turkey's blessing. Turkey has denied backing HTS."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg6eeg87lqo,Turkey's 3m Syrian refugees face big decision on going home or staying,10 Dec 2024,"Syrian refugees have been celebrating the fall of Bashar al-Assad in the streets of Turkish cities, welcoming the sudden collapse of his regime, and many are now considering whether they should go back home. Thousands of Syrians have flocked to Turkey's borders with Syria, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced the opening of a border gate ""to prevent any congestion and ease traffic"". But almost three million Syrians are currently living in Turkey, having fled their country's civil war since it began in 2011, and they will face a difficult decision on what they do next. Many Turks are also keen for Syrians to go back as soon as possible and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has said Turkey will work for their ""safe and voluntary return home"". The lives of Syrians in Turkey have become increasingly difficult in the past two years as Turks face an economic crisis with spiralling inflation. Turkey had long tried to talk to the ousted Assad regime about sending its refugees home. But most Syrians in Turkey will want to wait and see how the coming turbulent months unfold before making such a big decision. Metin Corabatir points out that the big influx into Turkey came initially as Syrians fled the Assad regime from 2011-2013. All Syrians in Turkey hold temporary protection status. The majority of them live in Istanbul and two border cities, Gaziantep and Sanliurfa. Because many have been here for so long, Syrian families have put down roots, sending their children to Turkish schools and universities. If they all go home at once it could have a significant effect on the Turkish economy. Murat Erdogan cautions that Turkey should not push Syrians to rush home all at once for the simple reason that there are big questions over infrastructure – a lack of schools, jobs and hospitals. Turks, he believes, should not see the Syrians living among them as a mass of people who will just pack up and leave all at once."

On Monday, Hamas said in a Telegram statement that sources in the group had “denied what some Israeli media outlets had circulated about Hamas leadership leaving Qatar to Turkey"". It followed a similar denial from the Turkish foreign ministry, with sources telling the Turkish news channel NTV: ""Hamas political bureau members visit Turkey from time to time. Allegations that the Hamas political bureau moved to Turkey do not reflect the truth.” He also declined to speculate on whether there would be any consequences for Turkey as a Nato ally if it did take in the Hamas leaders. Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organisation - unlike Israel, the US, the UK and many other Western countries - and members of the group often spend time there. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has defended Hamas as a resistance movement and been fiercely critical of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zj7rz3l4o,Turkish strikes in Syria cut water to one million people,19 Nov 2024,"Turkish air strikes in drought-struck north-east Syria have cut off access to electricity and water for more than a million people, in what experts say may be a violation of international law. Turkey carried out more than 100 attacks between October 2019 and January 2024 on oil fields, gas facilities and power stations in the Kurdish-held Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), according to data collated by the BBC World Service. Turkey said it had targeted the “sources of income and capabilities” of Kurdish separatist groups it regards as terrorists. The AANES has previously accused Turkey of seeking to “destroy our people’s existence”. People living in the region have been caught up not only in Syria’s ongoing civil war but also in Turkey’s conflict with Kurdish-led forces, who established the AANES in 2018 after they - with support from the US-led coalition - drove the Islamic State (IS) group out of the region. Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has described the AANES - which is not officially recognised by the international community - as a “terror state” next to its border. The Turkish government considers the Kurdish militia that dominates the main military force there to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) rebel group, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The PKK is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU, the UK and the US. The UN says Turkish forces carried out the strikes in Swadiyah, Amuda and Qamishli, while humanitarian groups say Turkey was behind the attack in Darbasiyah. Turkey said it had been targeting the PKK, the People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). “Civilians or civilian infrastructure were not among our targets and have never been,” Turkey said in a statement to the BBC. But in 2019, Turkey took control of the Ras Al-Ain area, where Alouk is situated, saying it needed to establish a “safe zone” to protect the country from what it described as terrorist attacks."

Kenyan authorities said the four, who were recognised by the UN as refugees, were deported at the request of the Turkish government, which wants them on treason charges. In the end, realpolitik triumphed, with Kenya not prepared to jeopardise its closer ties with Turkey, which saw the two countries sign a military co-operation agreement in July. The fate of the Turkish nationals since their deportation remains unclear. The four were believed to be part of the Gulen movement, named after the Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, which ran schools in Kenya and other parts of the world. Their deportation came soon after Gulen, whom Turkey accused of plotting a failed coup in 2016, died, suggesting that Turkey exploited his death to crack down on his supporters."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr957ee559o,Kurdish militant group behind attack on Turkish aerospace firm,25 Oct 2024,"A Kurdish militant group has said it was responsible for an attack on a state-owned defence manufacturer's headquarters near the Turkish capital, Ankara, which saw five people killed. The PKK said it had targeted Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) on Wednesday because the arms it produced had killed ""thousands"" of Kurds, including women and children. In a statement, the group said the attack, which also saw 22 people injured, was ""planned a long time ago"" - apparently rebuffing claims that the attack was an attempt to frustrate rumoured reconciliation efforts between the PKK and Turkish government. TAI is a key supplier for Turkey's military, providing its F-16 fighter jets. The Turkish government had previously implicated the PKK in the attack, identifying the assailants as PKK members Ali Orek and Mine Sevjin Alcicek. Turkey says it killed 59 ""terrorists"" in the strikes - though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said 12 civilians were among the dead, including children. The Ministry of Defence said Turkish forces had since killed more PKK militants. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country’s significant Kurdish minority. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the attack ""heinous"". TAI is a major player in Turkey’s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use. As well as being the Nato member's licensed manufacturer of US-designed F-16 fighter jets, the company also plays a role in modernising older aircraft for the Turkish military. The HPG said it ""does not take actions frequently as a principle"", but occasionally carried out ""self-sacrificing"" acts that served as ""warnings and messages"" to the Turkish government. The victims were named by Turkey's state-run news agency as TAI employees Cengiz Coskun, Zahide Guclu, Atakan Sahin Erdogan, Huseyin Canbaz, as well as taxi driver Murat Arslan. The HPG also said Wednesday's attack was ""nothing to do with the political agenda debated in Turkey in the last month""."

The Turkish government said that the strikes since Wednesday had killed 59 people it described as ""terrorists"". Various videos from the attack earlier on Wednesday show at least two people firing guns around the entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), which is located some 40km (25 miles) outside the capital. The Turkish defence ministry said that since Wednesday night and Thursday morning, its strikes had “successfully eliminated” 47 targets including caves, shelters, warehouses and other facilities in northern Iraq and Syria.

According to the the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Turkish warplanes and drones targeted infrastructure in northern and eastern Syria. The watchdog said Turkish forces resumed attacks on Thursday morning, with targets including a checkpoint near a train station, a bakery and power station. The Turkish defence ministry said earlier that ""all kinds of precautions were taken to prevent harm to innocent civilians, friendly elements, historical and cultural assets and the environment"".

The four were repatriated at the request of the Turkish government, Kenya's foreign ministry said. A British national told the BBC he and several Turkish citizens had been kidnapped by masked men. Kenya's foreign ministry said it had agreed to Turkey's request to repatriate the four men because of the country's ""robust historical and strategic relations"" with Turkey, and that it had been assured the refugees would be ""treated with dignity"". The four are believed to be followers of the Gulen movement, a powerful Islamic community with followers in Turkey and worldwide, whose leader has just died. Known as Hizmet or ""service"" in Turkey, it was blamed for a 2016 coup attempt and later declared a terrorist organisation. Turkish authorities have not yet commented on the repatriation. The British national, Necdet Seyitoğlu, told the BBC six other people he knew - all Turkish citizens - were also abducted in the same manner from different locations in Nairobi. Turkey's relationships with African countries has grown over the past 20 years, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan seeking to strengthen ties.

The cleric, who had been living in self-imposed exile in the US, died after being admitted to a Pennsylvania hospital, according to reports in Turkish media. Sometimes described as Turkey's second most powerful man, Gulen was the spiritual leader of the Gulen movement, a powerful Islamic community with followers in Turkey and worldwide. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the Gulen movement for the 2016 attempted coup, accusations Gulen denied. Speaking at a press conference in Ankara, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said intelligence sources had confirmed Gulen's death, describing him as the leader of a ""dark organisation"". Gulen rose to prominence by arguing that young people in Turkey had lost their way and education was the best response. His movement - known in Turkey as Hizmet or ""service"" - first gained a foothold running schools, and it went on to open educational institutions across Turkey and around the world. Hizmet was once an ally of Erdogan's, but the Turkish president turned on the movement in 2013, vowing to shut down hundreds of its schools and rid the government of Gulenists, who he called a ""state within a state"". Gulen-allied police officers were accused of carrying out raids against Erdogan's allies, and the Turkish government formally declared Hizmet a terrorist organisation in May 2016. Two months later, a faction of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow Erdogan. It said its aim was to protect democracy from the authoritarian Turkish president. Over the course of a violent night, TV stations were raided by soldiers, explosions were heard in Istanbul and Ankara, protesters were shot and the parliament and presidential buildings were fired upon. Turkey requested his extradition to face trial but the US has said it needed to see evidence of his involvement in the coup first. The cleric proved elusive throughout the interview and dodged questions on who he would vote for in the upcoming Turkish elections."

Turkey passed a controversial law in July to get millions of dogs off the streets and into shelters, but critics claim it could lead to mass culling to save cost and space, with many facilities already overcrowded. Ms Smart's rescue centre in Turkey has just had to find extra space to take in 21 dogs - all Golden Retrievers - on top of the 55 currently there. Turkey's government estimates there are around four million stray dogs in the country. Turkish lawmakers say stray dogs are attacking people or causing serious traffic accidents. Under the new rules, any dogs with untreatable diseases or are aggressive will be put down, though Turkey's government insists all healthy animals will be put up for adoption."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjer5ewr34jo,Leaving Syria's civil war to be a mercenary in Africa,16 Jul 2024," Unable to earn enough to support them, he, like hundreds of others, has decided to travel via Turkey to Niger to work as a mercenary. He is a member of Turkish-backed opposition forces that have been fighting President Bashar al-Assad for more than a decade. The faction he works for pays him less than $50 (£40) a month, so when Turkish recruiters appeared offering $1,500 a month to work in Niger, he decided it was the best way to earn more money. Since December 2023, more than 1,000 Syrian fighters have travelled to Niger via Turkey, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which monitors the conflict in Syria through a network of sources on the ground. Before they go, the official line is that the men will be protecting Turkish projects and commercial interests in Niger. Turkey has extended both its political influence and business operations in the region, selling equipment such as drones to Niger to help it combat militant jihadist groups. “We are mercenaries here and mercenaries there,” says Abu Mohammad, “but I am on a Turkish mission, I will not accept orders from the Russians.” The recruits we spoke to said their faction leaders had told them that a Turkish company called SADAT would look after them once the contracts were signed and would be involved in arranging their travel and logistics. The company added that it did ""not provide services to non-state actors"" but rather provided “consultancy, training and logistics services to armed forces and security forces in the field of defence and security according to the Turkish Commercial Code”. But private companies are used by the government in Ankara to recruit and send Syrian mercenaries to Niger, according to the SOHR. The organisation’s director, Rami Abdul Rahman, accuses the Turkish state of exploiting Syrians with no money and dire economic prospects. The BBC put these allegations to the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs, but we have not received a response. This is not the first time the Turkish government has been accused of sending Syrian fighters abroad. Several reports, including one by the US Department of Defence, have documented Turkish-backed Syrian fighters in Libya - Turkey previously acknowledged that Syrian fighters were present there but did not admit recruiting them."

Turkey caught most of you out too - of more than 95,000 votes, only 12% of you backed them to progress - but you were right about the outcome of the other seven ties. What a game Turkey's last-16 win win over Austria was. I am at this quarter-final for Radio 5 Live and am looking forward to seeing Turkey and their fans in Berlin - their supporters have brought so much to this tournament. I loved the way Turkey fought to get over the line against Austria - and they did it without their captain, Hakan Calhanoglu, who was suspended for that game but will be back for this one. Mert Gunok's incredible save in stoppage time was something people will talk about for years and I guess he will now be known as the 'Turkish Gordon Banks'. There were many reasons why I expected Austria to win that tie, but Turkey were much better organised defensively than I thought they would be, so credit to their manager, Vincenzo Montella. Turkey will need to do it all again to get past the Netherlands, and that is such a big ask. This is going to be close but, rather than predicting Turkish delight, it will be a case of a double Dutch strike sending them through."

Turkey were hanging on to a 2-1 lead in the face of relentless late pressure when, in the 94th minute, Austria mounted one last attack.

The reward for Turkey and their army of devoted fans is a quarter-final against the Netherlands in Berlin on Saturday, and Montella feels anything is possible with their support.

The Turkish trade ministry said the measures would be in place until Israel allowed an ""uninterrupted and sufficient flow"" of aid into Gaza. Israel's foreign minister accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of acting like a ""dictator"". Israel Katz said on X that Mr Erdogan was ""disregarding the interests of the Turkish people and businessmen and ignoring international trade agreements"". He added that he had instructed the foreign ministry to find alternatives for trade with Turkey, with a focus on local production and imports from other countries. The ministry also says it will also take action to reduce economic connections between Turkey and the Palestinian Authority and Gaza, the BBC understands. Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat criticised Israel's ""uncompromising attitude"" towards a ceasefire, as well as the humanitarian situation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah: ""Turkey has suspended all export and import with Israel until a permanent ceasefire is established and the aid into the Gaza is allowed without any interruption."" In 1949, Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel. In 2010, Turkey broke off diplomatic ties with Israel after 10 pro-Palestinian Turkish activists were killed in clashes with Israeli commandos who boarded a Turkish-owned ship trying to break Israel's maritime blockade of the Gaza Strip. Mr Netanyahu has said Turkey's leader is the last person who can preach morality to Israel. The Turkish leader has for months come under domestic political pressure to announce measures against Israel, from both opponents and allies. Not long after the vote, Turkey imposed restrictions on 54 products being exported to Israel, from iron and steel to jet fuel, pesticides and construction equipment. The trade ministry in Ankara said on Thursday that the action was now being extended to all exports and imports. Israel was Turkey's 13th biggest export market in 2023, receiving 2.1% of Turkish exports last year. Turkey was Israel's fifth biggest source of imports last year."

Their decision led to protests and clashes across south-eastern Turkey. Van was one of 10 areas won by the pro-Kurdish DEM party in Turkey's south and south-east in last Sunday's local elections. The ruling AK Party suffered its first election defeat across the country since 2002, as the main opposition party, the CHP, won in 35 provincial capitals and regained control of the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara. Then thousands of people took to the streets in other Turkish cities in the south and south-east, and there were rallies and protests as far west as Izmir and Istanbul. On Thursday, Turkey's Supreme Election Council decided to overturn the regional decision to annul Mr Zeydan's victory, prompting party officials to say that ""the will of the people has come to life"". Among the biggest winners in Sunday's election was Istanbul's popular opposition mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is increasingly being seen as the CHP's most likely candidate in the next presidential elections in 2028. The CHP was beaten by the AK Party by fewer than 4,000 votes in Hatay province in the far south of Turkey, and accuses the governing party of trying to steal the election there."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68704375,Turkish opposition stuns Erdogan with local elections win,1 Apr 2024,"Turkey's main opposition party has claimed big election victories in the main cities of Istanbul and Ankara. He led the campaign to win in Istanbul, where he grew up and became mayor. Mr Erdogan had vowed a new era in Turkey's megacity of almost 16 million people, but the incumbent mayor of Istanbul secured more than 50% of the vote, defeating the president's AK Party candidate by more than 11 points and almost one million votes. In the capital Ankara, opposition mayor Mansur Yavas was so far ahead of his rival on 60% that he declared victory when fewer than half the votes were in. Significantly it also gained control of Turkey's fourth-biggest city Bursa and Balikesir in the north-west, as well as Adiyaman, which hit hard by last year's double earthquake in the south-east. President Erdogan, 70, acknowledged the election had not gone as he had hoped, but he told supporters in Ankara it would mark ""not an end for us but rather a turning point"". Under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's presidency has amassed sweeping powers, replacing the prime minister. The outcome was a big success for the chairman of the CHP, Ozgur Ozel, who praised voters for deciding to change the face of Turkey in a historic vote: ""They want to open the door to a new political climate in our country."" Crowds in Istanbul gathered outside the town hall in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts. They waved Turkish flags and banners showing Ekrem Imamoglu's picture alongside Turkey's founding father Kemal Ataturk, whose poster was draped down the walls of the local authority building. ""Everything will be fine,"" Imamoglu supporters chanted as they danced to drums and clarinets in Sarachane, one of Istanbul's oldest districts. Istanbul's incumbent mayor had first used the slogan when he won the city from Mr Erdogan's party five years ago. Mehmet Bankaci, 27, told the BBC there was a need for change in Turkey: ""If Imamoglu or Mansur Yavas had been the CHP candidate in last year's presidential election, they definitely would have won.""

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68663417,Battle to run Istanbul becomes key to Turkey's future,31 Mar 2024,"Millions of Turks have voted in elections to decide who runs their biggest cities - and whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can wrest back control from the opposition. Turkey's economic and social powerhouse, Istanbul, was won by a united opposition five years ago under popular mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, shattering the president's long run of electoral success. Whatever happens in Istanbul is being seen as a crucial test of whether the opposition can pose a serious threat to Mr Erdogan and his AK Party in the next presidential elections in four years' time. ""Istanbul is his home. Losing Istanbul to the opposition in the 2019 local elections was devastating for him,"" says Ihsan Aktas of the department of communication at Istanbul Medipol University and chair of the Genar Political Research Centre. Istanbul was where he grew up, selling sesame bread snacks called Simits before going into politics in the 1970s. He headed an Islamist party's youth branch in the district of Beyogluthen, and rose through the ranks to become mayor, prime minister and ultimately president of Turkey. Not just Istanbul, but the capital Ankara and the tourist city of Antalya. In Istanbul the opposition even defeated his candidate twice, as the AKP alleged there had been irregularities and officials ordered a re-run. ""Although the opposition lost against Erdogan in last year's presidential election, there is still a strong link between winning Istanbul and winning Turkey,"" says Seda Demiralp, professor of political science at the city's Isik University. ""If Imamoglu manages to keep Istanbul, the opposition will still have high hopes for the upcoming 2028 presidential elections."" Ihsan Aktas agrees that whoever wins will have enormous influence beyond Istanbul: ""When you have the backing of Istanbul, you directly become an actor in the national politics. The city hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people, and it has a diverse electorate from different political, ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds. Control Istanbul and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance. The candidate chosen to run for Mr Erdogan's party in Istanbul is Murat Kurum, a 47-year-old former minister for the environment and urbanisation."

It was not the first massive pro-Palestinian rally in Turkey since the start of Israel-Gaza war on 7 October. But Monday's mass protest followed incendiary remarks by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Since he first came to power more than 20 years ago, Turkey has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinians, including Hamas. Mr Erdogan has made comparisons with Nazi Germany in the past, but the current war of words has put into sharp focus just how bitter Turkish-Israeli relations have become, just months after a significant upturn. In the latest broadside against Israel, Turkey announced on Tuesday that it had detained 33 people suspected of working for Israeli intelligence service Mossad in raids across eight provinces. The operation, carried out with Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, followed reports that Israel intended to hunt down members of Hamas abroad, including in Turkey. Turkey has stepped up support for Gaza since 7 October, for example bringing dozens of patients from Gaza to Turkey for treatment. Turkey's health minister himself accompanied the casualties en route from Egypt. This hostility to Israel plays to President Erdogan's support base in Turkey, says Helin Sari Ertem, Associate Professor of International Relations at Istanbul Medeniyet University. ""Palestine has long been a cause for Turkey and the Turkish people, covering almost all political tendencies,"" she says. ""Consequently, it is not possible for Turkish governments to consider the Palestine-Israeli conflict only as a foreign policy issue; as it definitely is a game-changer in domestic politics."" In the second half of the 20th Century, Israel and Turkey enjoyed close economic and strategic relationships. Turkey was also the first country in the region to formally recognise Israel after it was founded. In 2006, then-Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal visited Turkey following an invitation from Mr Erdogan. The first diplomatic crisis between Israel and Turkey played out before a world audience when in 2009, Mr Erdogan stormed out of a meeting during the World Economic Forum in Davos after a clash with Israel's then-President Shimon Peres over Israeli air strikes in Gaza."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67691381,Turkish referee attack is crisis that goes beyond football,12 Dec 2023,"One of Turkey's top football officials may quit the game after he was physically attacked on the pitch by the president of an Ankara club and its fans. The violent attack on elite referee Halil Umut Meler has left Turkish football in a full-blown crisis and magnified concerns about Turkey's institutions. The referee was treated in hospital after he was punched in the face by MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca, after the Ankara-based team conceded a late equaliser in the Turkish capital against Super Lig rivals Caykur Rizespor. The dramatic events after the final whistle underscore the intense emotions surrounding football in Turkey. The sport is massively popular in the country of 85 million people and is a platform that links Turkish politics, business and culture. The attack has prompted the 37-year old referee on Uefa's elite list to contemplate quitting, according to Ali Kunak, former general secretary of the Turkish Football Federation's central arbitration board, who spoke to Meler and local media on Tuesday. The violence has also led to an indefinite suspension of Turkish Super Lig games. The Turkish Football Federation, in a post on X, said it condemned the ""inhumane, despicable attack"", which it blamed in part on ""irresponsible statements of club presidents, managers, coaches, and TV commentators targeting referees"". Violence has long been associated with Turkish football, where it is common to see a heavy police presence at matches across the country. ""Football is not only football,"" said Ozgehan Senuva, professor of international relations at Ankara's Middle East Technical University. ""This is only a reflection of the general social situation in Turkey."" Many Turks and the country's Western allies worry about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's tightening grip on Turkey's key institutions, including the judicial system. The vast bulk of Turkey's media is controlled by the Erdogan government - 90%, according to Reporters Without Borders - but football has turned into a key venue for political discourse. But the violence shown towards Halil Umut Meler ""is a new threshold for Turkish football"", according to Omer Turan, an international relations professor at Istanbul's Bilgi University."

Wales needed to beat Group D winners Turkey and hope Croatia dropped points at home to Armenia and, for much of Tuesday night, it seemed like Robert Page's side would fulfil their part of that equation as Neco Williams fired them in front in the seventh minute. But Croatia's victory over Armenia meant even a Welsh win would not have been enough and, to make matters worse, Turkey equalised midway through the second half thanks to a controversial penalty scored by Yusuf Yazici. Wales target Euro play-offs after Turkey controversy Page's men needed to overcome already-qualified Turkey - in itself no mean feat - while also requiring Croatia, World Cup semi-finalists less than a year ago and runners-up in 2018, to drop points at home to Armenia, 85 places below them in the world rankings. Wales kept attacking too, streaming forward and silencing the boisterous travelling Turkish fans. Having weathered that pressure, Turkey had a decent spell of their own as Kerem Akturkoglu shot over from close range - but Wales were still the better side. Turkey then twisted the knife when they were given the softest of penalties, as Wales captain Davies brushed against Yildiz, who threw himself to the ground. Yazici calmly sent Danny Ward the wrong way with his low penalty and, buoyed by their equaliser, Turkey were close to taking the lead when Yusuf Sari's long-range shot brushed the bar. Roared on by their furious supporters, Wales rallied and put Turkey under pressure late on, gamely pushing for a winner even though Croatia's 1-0 win over Armenia ultimately meant their efforts were in vain."

Straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, Turkey's strategically important location has given it major influence in the region - and control over the entrance to the Black Sea. Progress towards democracy and a market economy was halting after Ataturk's death in 1938. Membership talks were launched in 2005, but have stalled over serious misgivings about Turkey's human rights record. Kurdish separatists who accuse the Turkish state of seeking to destroy their cultural identity have been waging a guerrilla war since the 1980s.

In July 2016, the AKP government survived an attempted coup which saw clashes on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara that left 256 people dead.

Turkey says killings occurred on both sides and denies that those suffered by Armenians amount to genocide. 1918-22 - Partition of defeated Ottoman Empire leads to eventual triumph of Turkish National Movement in war of independence against foreign occupation and the rule of the Sultan."

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who visited Turkey last month, said the partnership was backed by some funding but he would not say how much, telling GB News it was ""not primarily about money"" but sharing information. The government said the new centre of excellence, which will be established by the Turkish National Police, would help the two countries share intelligence so staff could act more quickly on information. It said more officers would also be deployed to Turkey to enable collaboration between National Crime Agency and Home Office staff based in the country and their Turkish counterparts. Turkey shares the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe - the Turkish-Bulgarian check point at Kapikule. In the first seven months of this year 1,486 Turkish nationals crossed the Channel to the UK by small boat, becoming the second most common nationality to do so behind Afghans, according to Home Office figures. There has been a steady increase in Turkish arrivals since last year, with the country suffering a devastating earthquake in February which left an estimated 1.5 million people homeless. Turkey is also facing a worsening economic crisis, with inflation hovering stubbornly at just under 50%. The UK returned 191 Turkish nationals in 2022, with 1,076 arriving by small boats that year. Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was ""working very closely"" with Turkey to return Turkish nationals and putting in place arrangements to streamline the process. There is some optimism within government circles a returns deal with Turkey may not be far off, with the upcoming UK-Turkey Migration Dialogue meeting scheduled for the autumn in London. The European Union has an agreement with Turkey to return migrants crossing from the country illegally into the bloc. ""Our partnership with Turkey, a close friend and ally, will enable our law enforcement agencies to work together on this international problem and tackle the small boat supply chain."""

In Hatay alone, some 23,000 people died and more than 30,000 were injured, according to Turkey's disaster management agency, Afad. The following month, the Turkish government assessed that no-one should remain in short-term shelters for more than six months. ""Turkey has faced a huge test in this regard,"" Mr Yayman says.

His sudden change of tack highlights just how much the newly re-elected president is looking to mend diplomatic relations with the West and reassure foreign investors who have ditched Turkey in recent years because of its economic woes. It comes out of nowhere, the sudden shift in policy and tone,"" said Batu Coskun, an Ankara-based political analyst at the Sadiq Institute think tank. Turkey now looks on course to receive a long-awaited delivery of F-16 fighter jets from the United States, and Mr Erdogan says Brussels is ""positive"" about reviving Ankara's long-stalled bid to join the EU and moving forward on visa liberalisation. But the swiftness of his change of heart is being seen as a clear sign he is taking a more constructive approach with US and European allies who, for years, have worried about democratic backsliding in Turkey. Confidence abroad, but urgency at home to revive Turkey's floundering economy. Instead he has kept pressure on the Turkish central bank to keep borrowing costs low. Burhan Morkoc runs his small bakery with three brothers in Istanbul's Kadıkoy neighbourhood. To help ease such burdens, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, a Wall Street veteran whom President Erdogan appointed to the job last month, has vowed to restore ""rational economic policy"". As he flew home from the Nato summit in Lithuania, President Erdogan's focus was on his promise to the Turkish public to restore economic prosperity. Repairing Turkey's embattled $900bn (£685bn) economy will take time and patience, economists say.

Turkey also needs to win back the confidence of foreign investors. Its current account deficit reached $37.7bn in the first five months of this year - a record level that means Turkey spent far more on imports than it made selling exports."

Turkey argued Sweden was giving refuge to Kurdish militants, and needed to do more to crack down on rebel groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organisation. Like any of Nato's 31 member countries, Turkey has the power to block new nations from joining the group. He told Sweden's public TV network SVT that he and his team had ""worked very hard"" to address Turkey's concerns about terrorism, and that an agreement had been reached after being allowed to showcase their efforts. Sweden has also resumed arms exports to Turkey. This is also a major win for Turkey. As well as having Ankara's security concerns addressed, Sweden has promised actively to support Turkey's efforts to join the European Union, and ""step up economic co-operation"". Now that Turkey has ended its opposition to Sweden joining Nato, the US has agreed to fresh talks about Turkey buying F-16 fighter jets. Some observers including Wolfgang Hansson, a commentator for Sweden's largest tabloid Aftonbladet, argue that Sweden has potentially been used as a bargaining chip in a much bigger game being played by the Turkish leader. ""Media coverage of all the twists and turns has been intense, so many people have followed this closely, trying to interpret Erdogan's every new move,"" says Paul Levin, director of Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, who has followed the developments closely. There are also concerns about the impact of negotiating with Turkey, a nation with a questionable human rights record."

He said the Turkish leader would forward Sweden's bid to parliament in Ankara and ""ensure ratification"". Turkey had previously spent months blocking Sweden's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. As one of Nato's 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group. ""I stand ready to work with President Erdogan and Turkey on enhancing defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area. Mr Stoltenberg announced the agreement late on Monday following talks between the Turkish and Swedish leaders in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. The Nato chief described it as a ""historic step"", but stressed that a ""clear date"" could not be given for when Sweden would join the military alliance - as this relied on the Turkish parliament. Mr Stoltenberg said Turkey and Sweden had addressed ""Turkey's legitimate security concerns"" and as a result Sweden had amended its constitution, changed its laws, expanded its counter-terrorism operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. Turkey and Hungary are currently the only two Nato members yet to ratify Sweden's membership application. On Monday, President Erdogan had also appeared to link Turkish support for Sweden's Nato bid to the EU re-opening frozen membership talks with Ankara. But in a statement after the deal was announced, Nato said Sweden would actively support efforts to ""reinvigorate Turkey's EU accession process"" and this would include ""modernisation of the EU-Türkiye customs union and visa liberalisation"". Turkey first applied to join the EU way back in 1987, but its drift towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan brought the accession process to a halt. Turkey has helped keep the deal alive, despite frequent Russian threats to withdraw. But Turkey has also angered the Kremlin by supplying armed drones to Ukraine. Russian officials were also furious at the weekend when Turkey, in a surprise move, allowed five former commanders of the Ukrainian garrison at Mariupol to fly back to Kyiv at the end of a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky."

After months of holding up Sweden's bid for membership of Nato, arguing that Stockholm is guilty of harbouring Kurdish militants, Mr Erdogan suddenly pivots to an entirely unrelated issue: Turkey's longstanding bid to join the European Union (EU). If Turkey can't join the EU, he seems to be saying, then nor can Sweden join the Nato military alliance. Turkey first applied to join the EU way back in 1987, but its drift towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan brought the accession process to a halt. But as an established member of Nato (since 1952), Turkey has power: all Nato members have to agree before any new members are admitted. On the eve of the summit in Vilnius, Nato's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is convening a meeting between the Turkish president and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. Most diplomats believe the Turkish leader is using his leverage to extract concessions from the alliance, possibly including the sale of F-16 jets by the US. Another Nato member (and long-time rival of Turkey), Greece wants assurances that Ankara will not use American-supplied jets to violate its sovereignty. Turkey has helped the keep the deal alive, despite frequent Russian threats to withdraw. But Turkey has also angered the Kremlin by supplying armed drones to Ukraine. Russian officials were also furious at the weekend when Turkey, in a surprise move, allowed five former commanders of the Ukrainian garrison at Mariupol to fly back to Kyiv at the end of a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Under the terms of a prisoner exchange last year, Russia expected the men to remain in Turkey until the end of the war. But by holding out on Swedish membership and throwing Turkey's EU ambitions into the mix so late in the day, Mr Erdogan will not have endeared himself to his fellow leaders in Vilnius."

Hungary has also stalled on backing the Swedish bid, but said it will not delay the process if Turkey shifts its stance. Finland became the 31st member of the alliance in April after Turkey withdrew objections similar to those it has to Sweden's application. Ankara's bid to join the EU has been frozen for years. Members voted to suspend talks on the issue in 2016 over Turkey's crackdown on opponents following a failed coup attempt in the same year.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66119743,Sweden jails Kurd for financing terrorism,6 Jul 2023,"Turkey has long called on Stockholm to crack down on Kurdish separatists. Sweden's bid to join Nato has been delayed principally by Turkey's demand that it extradites dozens of people it views as terrorists. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet the Swedish prime minister in Lithuania on Monday ahead of a Nato summit, where Sweden is hoping to be welcomed into the Western defensive alliance. Last month prosecutor Hans Ihrman stressed that the timing of the case was ""pure coincidence"", even though Turkey had urged Sweden to use terror laws to target Kurds suspected of having links to PKK militants. But the timing was not lost on commentators who pointed out that it sent a message to Ankara that Sweden was getting tough on the PKK, which launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state in 1984. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the case was an example of how organised crime in Sweden was linked to terrorist organisations in Turkey. The 41-year-old Kurdish man who was jailed on Thursday has Turkish origins and the judge said he would be deported as soon as he had served his sentence. Last month the government also announced it would extradite a Turkish Kurd who was legally resident in Sweden. Turkey said it was because of a drug crime but the man argued he was being pursued because of his support for Turkey's biggest pro-Kurdish political party. Thursday's jail sentence coincided with a key meeting in Brussels involving the foreign ministers of Sweden, Turkey and Finland, ahead of next week's Nato summit in Vilnius. Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Swedish radio she was hoping for a quick announcement on Nato membership, even though Turkey had made no promises. Finland and Sweden decided to join Nato in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Finland officially became a member in April after Turkey eventually withdraw its initial objections. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly highlighted problems with Sweden's bid, saying even this week that it needed to do more on its ""homework"".

Turkey's leader has until now insisted on keeping interest rates down. Inflation is almost 40% and Turks are in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis. The head of Turkey's central bank, Hafize Gaye Erkan, 44, was only recruited from the US this month in the wake of Mr Erdogan's re-election as president. Although the increase almost doubles Turkey's policy rate to 15%, it is far less than many economists had forecast. President Erdogan's problem is that Turkey's inflation rate remains stubbornly high and its central bank's reserves have fallen to critically low levels, after it spent billions of dollars trying to prop up the lira. Turkey's economy grew dramatically in the early years of President Erdogan's leadership. In the past five years, the Turkish currency has lost more than 80% of its value and foreign investment has plummeted. Turks are now trying to move foreign cash out of local banks. Mehmet Kerem Coban of Kadir Has University said Turkey's economic model needed capital to survive because its reserves had melted away. Although the rate hike was intended to stabilise the Turkish lira, investors appeared unimpressed and it continued to slide against the dollar. Mr Erdogan has been in power in Turkey for more than 20 years. Although a former member of Erdogan's government, Mr Simsek has made clear Turkey's only economic choice is to return to ""rational ground"" and ""compliance with international norms"". A well-known figure on Wall Street, she has never had a role in Turkey before and was chief executive of US bank First Republic, leaving around a year before it collapsed.

Wales almost took the lead from nothing, as Turkey failed to deal with a clearing ball before Merih Demiral brought down Dan James, and from the resulting free-kick Harry Wilson forced a top-class save out of Mert Gunok. As the hour mark ticked by Turkey were still struggling to break down Wales, but were handed a golden opportunity when Aaron Ramsey was penalised for handball in the area. Up stepped Turkey talisman and Inter Milan midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu, but his penalty was a nice height for Ward, who got down to his right to turn the ball away from danger. Turkey v Wales - as it happened and reaction Moments later, Turkey thought they had taken the lead once more, as Ward failed to deal with a low cross and substitute Umut Nayir turned the ball in. Victory leaves Turkey in pole position in Group D, while Wales could already be staring down the barrel of the play-offs if they are to reach Euro 2024. After Friday's embarrassing 4-2 home defeat against Armenia, a trip to Turkey provided an opportunity for Wales and manager Robert Page to right the ship. Wales were unquestionably more resilient and better organised against a Turkey team who dominated possession for long periods, even before Morrell's red card. Turkey notched up eight shots in the first half, however Wales were able to limit them to long-distance efforts for the most part. But the Turkish pressure told when Nayir's header was not stopped by a weak save from Ward, and there was little anyone in a white shirt could do minutes later to prevent Guler's phenomenal effort. Wales' loss however is Turkey's gain, as they did what Page targeted in claiming six points following their away win at Latvia last time out. Turkey are three points clear at the top of Group D having played four games, while surprise package Armenia followed up victory in Cardiff last week with a home win over Latvia earlier on Monday. If Turkey can avoid a similar fate as Wales in their remaining fixture against Armenia, a place at Euro 2024 will be within their grasp."

Gould and his players arrived in Istanbul with their hopes of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup, as usual at the time, almost non-existent. The Netherlands and Belgium were Group 7's heavyweights but few away fixtures during that decade instilled fear like one in Turkey. Istanbul in particular was a hotbed for intimidating atmospheres; think of the infamous 'Welcome to hell' greeting from Galatasaray fans' for Manchester United in 1993. Wales forward Dean Saunders had played for Gala during the 1995-96 season but, for his international team-mates, a first visit to the Turkish capital was an assault on the senses. Gould's unorthodox methods were on full display in Istanbul, starting with his deployment of Wales' brightest attacking talent, Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs. The Giggs experiment backfired immediately as Turkey scored two goals in the first eight minutes. Wales wilted and conceded three unanswered goals as Sukur ended the game with four to give Turkey a 6-4 win. Wales will be back in Turkey on Monday night for the first time since that crazy night in 1997, unrecognisable from the anarchy of the 90s. Matches like this no longer hold any fear and, even for those who were in Istanbul 26 years ago, the scars have healed. They passed the test in Croatia and they'll be ready for it in Turkey."""

""The entire nation of 85 million won,"" he told cheering crowds outside his enormous palace on the edge of Ankara. Almost half the electorate in this deeply polarised country did not back his authoritarian vision of Turkey. Erdogan supporters celebrate win in divided Turkey The president made the most of his victory, with an initial speech to supporters atop a bus in Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, followed after dark by a balcony address from his palace to an adoring crowd that he numbered at 320,000 people. ""It is not just us who won, Turkey won,"" he declared, calling it one of the most important elections in Turkish history. He taunted his opponent's defeat with the words ""Bye, bye, Kemal"" - a chant that was also taken up by his supporters in Ankara. Supporters came from all over Ankara to taste the victory. There were Islamic chants, while some laid Turkish flags on the grass to pray. For a night, Turkey's economic crisis was forgotten. But the president admitted that tackling inflation was Turkey's most urgent issue. The Turkish lira has hit record lows against the dollar and the central bank has struggled to meet surging demand for foreign currency. ""If they continue with low interest rates, as Erdogan has signalled, the only other option is stricter capital controls,"" warns Selva Demiralp, professor of economics at Koc university in Istanbul. President Erdogan has accused his opposite number of siding with terrorists, and criticised him for promising to free a former co-leader of Turkey's second largest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP. Crowds flocked to Istanbul's Taksim Square, with many coming from the Middle East and the Gulf. Palestinians from Jordan wrapped Turkish flags around their shoulders. One voter outside an Ankara polling station on Sunday said he wanted to see an end to the brain drain that began with the post-coup purge. Turkey's defeated opposition will now have to regroup ahead of local elections in 2024."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65743475,Why Erdogan's victory matters for the West,29 May 2023,"You can spot Turkey's global strategic significance - which has starkly increased against the backdrop of the Ukraine war - by the A-list potpourri of world leaders who rushed to congratulate Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his election win on Sunday night. He was so keen to stroke the ego of his Turkish counterpart and fellow ""strongman"" leader that he didn't even wait for the official results of the vote before singling out Mr Erdogan's ""independent foreign policy"" as a reason for his victory. We can safely assume the Turkish policy that Russia is particularly fond of is Mr Erdogan's refusal to ostracise the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as Turkey's allies in Nato imposed sanctions and slashed their energy reliance on Russia. Trade between Turkey and Russia even increased significantly since the start of the war in Ukraine. Despite their dislike of Mr Erdogan's cosying up to the Kremlin and his slashing of free speech and democratic norms at home during his first two decades in power, to them Turkey is a crucial - if difficult and unpredictable - ally of the West. Turkey is a key member of the Nato military alliance, taking part in all its missions. Once a passionate advocate of Turkey joining the EU, Mr Erdogan these days speaks of ""making Turkey great again"". The West hopes the dire state of Turkey's economy - and the likelihood that Mr Erdogan will have to concentrate on stabilising finances and attracting foreign investment - could prove a soft spot to push for Sweden's Nato accession as a quid pro quo. Turkey and Hungary are the only Nato countries still blocking Stockholm's membership. Brussels subsequently made a deal with Turkey. In exchange for a large sum of money and visa-free travel for Turks into the EU - the latter never fully arrived because of EU objections to Mr Erdogan's jailing of critics and political opponents - the Turkish president would do his best to prevent migrants without papers leaving Turkish waters to reach the bloc. But swelling numbers of Syrian refugees at home proved extremely unpopular with Turkish voters. This month, every political party running in Turkey's parliamentary elections promised to take action to solve ""the migrant issue""."

Turkey's Islamist leader Mr Erdogan has a bond with his followers that goes back 20 years. As the run-off result was announced, the streets of the capital Ankara were a kaleidoscope of Turkish flags, blaring car horns, and cheering Erdogan supporters. This is the outcome President Vladimir Putin wanted - no surprises that he was one of the first to offer his congratulations to the Turkish leader. In his victory speech he insisted that ""only Turkey was the winner"" - but he lost no time in attacking the opposition and the LGBTQ community. There are few checks and balances here, and Turkey's longest-serving leader is not known for his restraint. Turkey is now a divided nation with a broken economy. And where does the election result leave Turkey's neighbours and its Nato allies?"
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65732194,Turkey's momentous vote after 20 years of Erdogan,28 May 2023,"Turks have finished voting in a historic presidential run-off to decide whether or not Recep Tayyip Erdogan should stay in power after 20 years. The president, who is favourite to win, promises a new era uniting the country around a ""Turkish century"". After voting in Ankara he urged Turks to protect the ballot boxes. As he voted in Istanbul, President Erdogan said Turkish democracy was going through a second round in a presidential election for the first time and suggested Turks should make use of it. It was a swipe at Mr Erdogan's enormous palatial complex on the edge of Ankara which he moved to when he switched from prime minister to president in 2014. ""The era of coups and juntas is over,"" he declared, linking Turkey's current stability to his own authoritarian rule. Turkey, however, is deeply polarised, with the president reliant on a support base of religious conservatives and nationalists, while his opposite number's supporters are mainly secular - but many of them are nationalist too. But after days of inflammatory rhetoric about sending millions of Syrian refugees home, the opposition candidate returned to Turkey's number-one issue - the economic crisis, and in particular its effect on poorer households. It may have been staged, but this is the story across Turkey, with inflation at almost 44% and salaries and state help failing to keep pace. The Turkish lira has hit record lows, demand for foreign currency has surged and the central bank's net foreign currency reserves are in negative territory for the first time since 2002. East of Ankara, gleaming tower blocks have been springing up in Kirikkale. Despite Turkey's stricken economy, she is putting her faith in the president. Turkey's second-biggest opposition party, the HDP, denies any link to the militant PKK, but President Erdogan has used their backing for the rival candidate to suggest a link to terrorists. Whoever wins on Sunday, Turkey's parliament is already firmly in the grip of Mr Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party and its far-right nationalist ally, the MHP."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679,Erdogan: Turkey's all-powerful leader of 20 years,28 May 2023,"From humble beginnings, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has grown into a political giant, leading Turkey for 20 years and reshaping his country more than any leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered father of the modern republic. Critics blamed his unorthodox economic policies for exacerbating Turkey's cost-of-living crisis. And for a pugnacious leader who built a proud record on modernising and developing Turkey, he appeared slow to react to the loss of more than 50,000 lives in double earthquakes in February. First as prime minister from 2003 and then as directly elected president since 2014, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has flexed Turkey's muscles as a regional power, championed Islamist causes and been quick to outmanoeuvre political opposition. Accusing his opponents of treating Turkey's electorate with contempt and failing to win them over he declared: ""As 85 million, we will protect our ballot, our will and our future."" Born in February 1954, Recep Tayyip Erdogan grew up the son of a coastguard, on Turkey's Black Sea coast. When he was 13, his father decided to move to Istanbul, hoping to give his five children a better upbringing. He attended an Islamic school before obtaining a degree in management from Istanbul's Marmara University - and playing professional football. As the party grew in popularity in the 1990s, Mr Erdogan was elected as its candidate for mayor of Istanbul in 1994 and ran the city for the next four years. But his party had been banned for violating the strict secular principles of the modern Turkish state. The  middle class expanded and millions were taken out of poverty, as Mr Erdogan prioritised giant infrastructure projects to modernise Turkey. By 2013, protesters took to the streets, partly because of his government's plans to transform a much-loved park in the centre of Istanbul, but also in a challenge to more authoritarian rule. It was a feud that would have dramatic repercussions for Turkish society. Critics complained he had chipped away at the pillars of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's secular republic. While religious himself, Mr Erdogan always denied wanting to impose Islamic values, insisting he supported the rights of Turks to express their religion more openly."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65708268,Erdogan and rival clash in final push for votes,27 May 2023,"The last hours of Turkey's presidential race have turned increasingly sour as Recep Tayyip Erdogan bids to extend his 20 years in power by five more. His rival met a group of women hit by Turkey's economic crisis, promising that, if elected, he would live modestly, rather than in a presidential palace. The broadcast has reached 24 million views by the latest count and Turkey has a population of 85 million. She's a member of the centre-right, nationalist Good party, which has backed the opposition challenger and has the only female leader in Turkish politics in Meral Aksener. The appearance was a smart move for a candidate trying to overcome his rival's inbuilt advantage of controlling about 90% of Turkish media. International monitors say voters may have had a genuine choice, but that Turkey ""did not fulfil the basic principles for holding a democratic election"". Anticipating an Erdogan victory and further economic instability, the financial markets reacted with the Turkish lira hitting record lows against the dollar on Friday. That will be of little concern in the town of Bala, an hour's drive to the south-east of Ankara. For months Turkey's struggling economy was the number one issue, but as Sunday's run-off has drawn close, the rhetoric has intensified and refugees are at the centre of it. Turkey is hosting more refugees than any other country, but nowhere near that many. As many as 85% of Turks want refugees from Syria's civil war to go home, opinion polls suggest. And he has gone on the attack too, using a manipulated video at a rally to link his rival to the Kurdish militant PKK, considered a terror group in the West as well as Turkey. The HDP, for now, backs Mr Kilicdaroglu because it wants an end to Turkey's ""one-man regime"". Initially it was thought that President Erdogan could be defeated because of his disastrous handling of Turkey's economy and his poor response to February's earthquakes."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65700865,What five more years of Erdogan would mean,26 May 2023,"After two decades in power and more than a dozen elections, Turkey's authoritarian leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan knows how to work a room. At a taxi drivers' convention in Istanbul, they could not get enough of him. The venue was a waterside convention centre in Istanbul, built during his time as mayor of the city. When Turks went to the polls earlier this month, they were not voting with their wallets. ""I think he is the [ultimate] Teflon politician,"" says Professor Soli Ozel, who lectures in international relations at Istanbul's Kadir Has University. ""It is a race to the bottom,"" according to one Turkish journalist. It is a message that goes down well in Turkey. Whoever is Turkey's next president, nationalism is already a winner here. Sitting on a red couch beneath a rainbow flag, Zeynep, 21, and Mert, 23, serve piping hot Turkish tea and worry about the future. It is almost 100 years since Turkey was founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk as a secular republic. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is promising a new ""Turkish century"" if he is re-elected. His supporters say he will deliver more development and a stronger Turkey. His critics say it will be less Ataturk, more Islamisation, and a darker future."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65483654,Turkey decides: Stark choice for voters,25 May 2023,"Turks are at a historic turning point - whether to keep their leader of more than 20 years or change to a more pro-Western path and roll back some of his sweeping presidential powers. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is favourite to win Sunday's run-off vote, and promises a strong, multilateral Turkey. His chief rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, backed by a broad opposition, has billed the vote as a referendum on the future direction of Turkey and has sought the support of nationalist voters to increase his chance of victory. Since 2017, Mr Erdogan has run Turkey with extensive presidential power, from a vast palace in Ankara. He accuses his opponents of being ""pro-LGBT"", while his Islamist-rooted party positions itself as on the side of the family and highlights its success in modernising Turkey. If he wins on Sunday, not much will change, says Selim Koru, a member of Turkey's Tepav think tank. But Alp Yenen, lecturer in Turkish studies at Leiden University, believes if Turkey's rampant inflation of more than 43% endures, the president's AK Party could accelerate what has been ""a slow pace of authoritarianism"". The president would become apolitical and the other five parties in the Kilicdaroglu alliance would each have a vice president, along with the two centre-left mayors of Ankara and Istanbul. Turkey is part of the West's Nato defensive alliance, but the Erdogan presidency has sought close ties with China and Russia too, buying a Russian S-400 air defence system and inaugurating a Russian-built nuclear plant - Turkey's first - ahead of the election. He advocates a multilateral stance, viewing Turkey as ""an island of peace and security"", and offering Ankara as a mediator in the Russian war in Ukraine. His opponent and his allies, meanwhile, want to return to the process of joining the European Union and restore Turkey's military ties with the US, while maintaining relations with Russia. If Mr Erdogan stays in power then Selim Koru believes he will continue to push Turkey away from the West, without leaving Nato. ""He wants to get Turkey to a point in the medium term or distant future where Nato membership is irrelevant."""
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-65671723,"Turkey and Africa: Drones, deals and dramas",25 May 2023,"Turkey's influence in Africa has been growing massively over the past 20 years and whoever wins Sunday's presidential run-off will have to consider where next to take the relationship. Ever since Recep Tayyip Erdogan took power in Turkey two decades ago, first as prime minister then as president, he has taken an increasing interest in Africa. The bond between Ankara and the continent is likely to only get stronger if the president is re-elected. ""Mr Kilicdaroglu stressed the need for recalibrating relations with the West and said he will try to revive the accession process to the European Union,"" says Serkan Demirtas, Ankara bureau chief for Hurriyet Daily News and a Turkish foreign policy expert. However, Ece Goksedef from the BBC's Turkish service points out that Turkey's foreign policy towards the continent would take some time to recalibrate, so it is unlikely it will change that drastically given the strong foundation of this new relationship. The seeds for the enhanced co-operation between Africa and Turkey were planted during Mr Erdogan's stint as prime minister, which began in 2003. ""In the early 2000s, the Turkish economy witnessed continued growth and was looking for new markets,"" says foreign policy expert Mr Demirtas. ""A diverse market with more than 50 countries and more than 1.2 billion people offers lucrative opportunities for Turkish exporters and businessmen."" Turkey's annual trade with the continent increased from $5.4bn (£4.4bn) to $34.5bn between 2003 and 2021, according to figures from the Turkish foreign ministry, led by chemicals, steel and cereals. The Turks were keen to stress that this was not an exploitative relationship and in 2013, then Prime Minister Erdogan said on a visit to Gabon that ""Africa belongs to Africans, we are not here for your gold"". Arms deals - also referred to as ""drone diplomacy"" - are a clear money-maker for Ankara. In the presence of Malian junta leader Col Assimi Goïta and a handful of Turkish diplomats, Mali's defence minister welcomed the new batch of the weapons saying that they ""can help make artillery and air strikes more accurate""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65309688,Mild-mannered challenger to Turkey's powerful Erdogan,25 May 2023,"He has mounted the strongest opposition challenge to Turkey's most powerful man, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, since he took power more than 20 years ago, but still fell short of his rival in the first round. His chances are looking slim in the 28 May run-off vote, but Turkey's mild-mannered opposition leader has assured supporters they have victory in their grasp. The former civil servant is the very antithesis of Turkey's grandstanding, powerful president. Seeking to attract nationalist votes, he highlighted his pledge to send home 3.5 million Syrian refugees within two years and accused his rival of allowing 10 million refugees into Turkey. Gone was his earlier inclusive tone, and the more nationalist stance risked alienating many Kurds in Turkey who provided a key source of support in the first round. He has survived a string of violent attacks, earning the reputation of being one of Turkey's most-targeted politicians, and wore a bullet-proof vest at his final rallies ahead of Sunday's vote. In a soft tone, he reached out to voters by saying that he would unite all of Turkey's different strands of society. The CHP charts its origins back to Turkey's modern secular founder Kemal Ataturk. He comes from an Alevi family - a distinct Islamic sect, and religious minority in mostly-Sunni Turkey. He was a star student at the many schools he attended as his family following his father's job around Turkey and later studied economics at Ankara University. He spent years as a civil servant in Turkey's financial bodies and won a reputation for weeding out corruption as director of the overarching Social Security Institution. After seven years in parliament, he was selected to run for one of Turkey's most powerful and prestigious roles, the mayor of Istanbul. Recep Tayyip Erdogan was by now at the peak of his power, becoming Turkey's most successful modern-era prime minister by winning almost half the vote for his Justice and Development or AK Party in 2011 elections. Erdogan's biggest challenge: How Turkey's elections work Kilicdaroglu pledges to restore Turkish democracy Turkey's Erdogan fighting to stay in power after 20 years In time he introduced religious figures, Kurdish activists and women's rights activists to the party - to prove to Turkish society that the CHP has changed."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65239092,Simple guide to Erdogan's fight to stay in power,23 May 2023,"Turkey is a Nato member state of 85 million people, so it matters who is president both to the West and to Turkey's other partners including Russia. Turkey has become increasingly authoritarian under President Erdogan and this was the opposition's biggest chance yet to defeat him, with Turks struggling with soaring inflation and reeling from twin earthquakes that have left more than 50,000 people dead. His AK Party has been in power since November 2002, and he has ruled Turkey since 2003. Although Turkey's 64 million voters are deeply polarised, the 69-year-old leader has an in-built advantage over his rival. Monitors from the international observer group OSCE said there was an unlevel playing field and biased coverage in Turkey's vote, even if voters had genuine political alternatives. Initially Mr Erdogan was prime minister, but he then became president in 2014, running the country from a vast palace in Ankara. Increasing numbers of Turks have blamed him for rampant inflation of 44%, and academics say the real rate is far higher than that. He and his ruling AK Party were widely criticised for their response to the double earthquakes in February that left millions of Turks homeless in 11 provinces. He also has the support of Turkey's second-biggest opposition party, the pro-Kurdish HDP, whose co-leader described the elections as ""the most crucial in Turkey's history"". A difficult feat when Turkey's nationalists want the next president to take a tougher line on Kurdish militants. Kemal Kilicdaroglu's selection was not universally popular as the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara were potentially stronger candidates. Both are party colleagues who took control of Turkey's two biggest cities in 2019 for the CHP for the first time since 1994. He is also a member of Turkey's Alevi minority, and when the opposition candidate drew attention to his roots Mr Erdogan accused him of seeking to exploit it. His Nation Alliance, also known as the Table of Six, are united in their desire to return Turkey from the presidential system created under Mr Erdogan to one led by parliament. Turnout in the first round was already very high at almost 89% among voters in Turkey."

Jimmy Wales told the BBC his organisation had spent two and a half years in court to avoid similar demands made by Turkey in the past. Twitter's owner Elon Musk said Turkey had threatened to block the whole site. In 2014, Turkish President Recep Erdogan did exactly that, vowing to ""wipe out"" the social network after corruption allegations about his administration were shared on the platform. Wikipedia was also banned in Turkey for almost three years after refusing to delete articles that criticised the government. Turkey's election will be decided in a run-off later this month, after no clear winner emerged from this weekend's voting. In a tweet, Twitter said four accounts and 409 tweets had been identified by the Turkish government in a court order, which the firm had then blocked. The content is still visible outside of Turkey. Twitter said it was told by the Turkish government that it was the only social network which had not complied with its court orders."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65593504,Erdogan leads as Turkey heads for election run-off,15 May 2023,"Turkey's battle for the presidency looks almost certain to go to a run-off, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan set for a four-point lead in the first round. For months, Turkey's disparate opposition parties had pooled their resources in a bid to bring an end to a president who has extended his power dramatically since a failed coup against him in 2016. And Turks went out to vote in very high numbers. The election is being watched very closely in the West, because Mr Kilicdaroglu has promised to revive Turkish democracy as well as relations with its Nato allies. On the other hand, President Erdogan's Islamist-rooted government has accused the West of plotting to bring him down and Turkey's candidacy for the EU has long been on ice. In the early hours of Monday, Mr Kilicdaroglu stood on a stage at his party headquarters in Ankara, flanked by his allies, doing his best to sound upbeat. Two rising stars in the party, the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, reminded voters that this was a strategy that Mr Erdogan's AK Party had used before. Turks have also been reeling from a cost-of-living crisis with 44% inflation, made only worse by Mr Erdogan's unorthodox economic policies. It was of little surprise that Turkey's Bist-100 stock market dropped 2.7% on Monday morning, and the Turkish lira fell back too. And yet, despite a very difficult few months, Turkey's dominant president appears to have the upper hand. His supporters ridiculed the opposition allies first for declaring that Mr Kilicdaroglu would become the 13th Turkish president, and then for gradually lowering their expectations as the night progressed. What this result does confirm is the extent to which Turkish society has become polarised, 100 years since Kemal Ataturk's foundation of the modern Turkish republic. In the final hours before voting began, Mr Kilicdaroglu rounded his campaign off with a trip to Ataturk's mausoleum in Ankara. President Erdogan instead chose to make a very symbolic statement to his conservative and nationalist support base, by making a campaign speech at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul."

Two issues have troubled Turkey's 64 million voters more than anything: soaring inflation and two earthquakes. Mr Kilicdaroglu, 74, arrived at a packed polling station at an Ankara school to chants of ""everything will be all right"", while one voter shouted out ""grandpa"", which has become a term of affection for young voters. Rampant inflation in Turkey is officially almost 44%, but many believe it is far higher. At an optician's in Ankara, Burak Onder complained that hardly anyone was buying glasses any more: ""People don't even ask for discounts, they can't afford it."" Hours before the vote, Twitter announced it had agreed to restrict access to some content in Turkey, prompting angry reaction. Turks have until 17:00 (14:00 GMT) to vote, although 1.76 million have already cast their ballots abroad in Germany, France and other countries - a record 53% turnout. Two women at an Ankara supermarket told the BBC they would miss out on voting because they were having medical treatment following the earthquake. President Erdogan, who is 69, was filmed stretching election rules by addressing worshippers after he led Saturday evening prayers at Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul. Video shared on social media showed him telling worshippers the Muslim world was closely following events in Turkey. But Ataturk turned it into a museum and it was President Erdogan who defied secular Turkey's founder and made it a mosque once more in 2020. But Turks are also voting for parliament and its 600 MPs. Although they have lost powers to Mr Erdogan's executive presidency since 2018, control of parliament remains key for passing legislation. Under Turkey's proportional voting system, parties form alliances so they can reach the 7% threshold required to enter parliament. The pro-Kurdish HDP, Turkey's second biggest opposition party, is part of another alliance, but has campaigned under a different name, the Green Left."

The end of the authoritarian Erdogan era - if it comes - should mean a freer, more democratic Turkey. In the run-up to the polls, Turks have had much to complain - and grieve - about, from the state's slow response to February's earthquakes to an economy in ruins. Here in southern Turkey, politics and economics are overshadowed by death. The official toll from the worst natural disaster in modern Turkish history is more than 50,000.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65385119,Turkish mass arrests in Kurdish areas ahead of vote,25 Apr 2023,"Turkish police have detained at least 126 people suspected of links to a banned Kurdish militant group, ahead of an election that could bring down President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkish reports said those held across 21 provinces were suspected of financing and helping to recruit for the outlawed PKK. Nineteen days before Turks vote in presidential and parliamentary elections, the HDP said those detained included lawyers who could scrutinise election security, independent journalists, who could cover potential voter fraud, and party campaign managers. Turkey's state news agency Anadolu said some of those held in Tuesday's raids were linked to 60 street protests as well as child abductions, and were led by public prosecutors in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir. The HDP denies links to the militant PKK, which is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and European Union. It is considered Turkey's second largest opposition party but has seen thousands of its members jailed, including former joint leader Selahattin Demirtas. The elections are being seen as Turkey's most significant for years, with six opposition parties uniting behind a single candidate in Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Mr Kilicdaroglu leads the Republican People's Party (CHP) and opinion polls give him a realistic chance of defeating Turkey's long-time leader Mr Erdogan, who has been in power for more than 20 years. He has accused Mr Erdogan's ruling AK Party of stigmatising millions of Turkish Kurds as terrorists to consolidate nationalist votes."

Dr Ahmed Ahmed, a leading surgeon and member of council at the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society, says he's treated patients returning from Turkey who have had an entirely different operation to the one they understood they had paid for. There are no records of the number of people who have travelled to Turkey for this kind of treatment. Officers passed on a phone number for the Turkish clinic - which Mick, Joe's father, rang.

Among them is Reem, who with her nine-month old baby wrapped in a blanket, said she was travelling back to Syria after her home in Turkey was destroyed. She told the BBC she believed hostility towards Syrians in Turkey had grown since the earthquake. ""We tried to find another place to stay but they [the Turkish] kept chasing us away asking us to return to Syria,"" she said. ""In Syria, there have been problems for 12 years, but right now the biggest catastrophe is in Turkey,"" he said at the Cilvegozu border crossing. About 1,500 Syrians living in Turkey are thought to have died in the earthquake. Around 3.5 million Syrians in Turkey are registered as refugees, according to the United Nations (UN). Meanwhile, rescue efforts are continuing in Turkey. While being carried on a stretcher, he was put on a video call with his parents who showed him his new-born baby, according to Turkish state news agency Anadolu. The death toll in Turkey now stands at more than 38,000, making it the deadliest in the country's history. The UN announced on Friday that more than 140 lorries carrying aid have crossed into north-western Syria from Turkey since the earthquake."

For this reason, 65% of the current building stock in Turkey is risky. How many other security guards and caretakers across Turkey had voiced similar concerns in a country precariously positioned at the crossroads of shifting tectonic plates? For opposition MP Garo Paylan, from the HDP party, who we meet as he visits this site, it is indicative of criminal negligence on an industrial scale in Turkish construction and oversight. Mr Paylan accuses the government of Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of failing to ensure the safety of new buildings as well as failing to strengthen older ones. He was stopped at Istanbul Airport as he tried to leave the country.

Faten has moved in with a friend in Kocaeli, closer to Istanbul. And Yemen's ambassador to Turkey, Muhammad Tariq, has visited the baby. Faten and her husband moved to Turkey after the Iranian-backed Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. Since the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen began in March 2015, the Yemeni community in Turkey has increased to more than 20,000. Yet even before the war, Yemenis were emigrating to Turkey for studies and work following the Arab Spring-inspired protests in 2011. Muhammad Amer, president of the Yemeni Students Union in Turkey, said there were now more than 8,000 Yemeni students in the country. Yemeni doctor Mohammed Al-Ara'awi, who arrived Turkey before the war, said he lost his wife, 16-year-old son and young daughter. ""Waiting on the rubble was like the Yemeni war that people lived through,"" he said from Istanbul.

The UN, among others, has repeatedly urged Syria and its allies to allow aid to flow into northern Syria from another route via Bab al-Salameh on the Turkish border, as well as a crossing from Iraq into the largely Kurdish areas of north-eastern Syria. This week, Syrian opposition groups announced that they had secured Ankara's approval, for the first time in years, to use corridors at Bab al-Salameh as well as another at al-Rai. This weekend, Mr Griffiths will travel to both Syria and Turkey ""to show solidarity with the people of both countries"". Much of north-western Syria is under the sway of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist movement designated as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and Washington, which tries to distance itself from past links to al-Qaeda. The United Arab Emirates, the first among Gulf Arab states to try to draw Damascus back into the Arab fold, partly to try to pull it from its close links to Iran, was quick to establish a humanitarian air bridge to both Syria and Turkey. Saudi Arabia has done the same, with other Arab states providing aid to either Syria or Turkey, or both. In recent months, before this latest crisis, there were also signs of a cautious rapprochement between Damascus and Ankara, which have been at daggers drawn throughout Syria's long war. In December, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, partly nudged by Russia, spoke of ""pouring oil on troubled waters"". But the presence of Turkish troops in northern Syria is a major irritant. Turkey, the US, Russia, and Iran all have forces somewhere on the ground, and Israeli warplanes are often in the air against suspected Iranian or Lebanese Hezbollah targets."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64594349,Quake failures leave Erdogan vulnerable in Turkey,11 Feb 2023,"Turkey's most devastating earthquake since 1939 has raised big questions about whether such a large-scale tragedy could have been avoided and whether President Erdogan's government could have done more to save lives. Turkey lies on two fault lines and has earthquake building codes dating back more than 80 years. It required a massive rescue operation spread across 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces. More than 6,000 buildings collapsed and workers from Turkey's Afad disaster authority were themselves caught up in the earthquakes. Turkey has more experience of earthquakes than almost any other country but the founder of the main volunteer rescue group believes this time, politics got in the way. After the last major earthquake in August 1999, it was the armed forces who led the operation but the Erdogan government has sought to curb their power in Turkish society. Instead, Turkey's civil disaster authority now has the role, with a staff of 10-15,000, helped by non-government groups such as Akut, which has 3,000 volunteers. President Erdogan has accepted that search efforts were not as fast as the government wanted, despite Turkey having the ""largest search and rescue team in the world right now"". For years, Turks have been warned of the potential of a big earthquake but few expected it to be along the East Anatolian fault, which stretches across south-eastern Turkey, because most of the larger tremors have hit the fault in the north. When a quake in January 2020 hit Elazig, north-east of Monday's disaster zone, geological engineer Prof Naci Gorur of Istanbul Technical University realised the risk. One of Turkey's foremost earthquake engineering specialists, Prof Mustafa Erdik, believes the dramatic loss of life was down to building codes not being followed, and he blames ignorance and ineptitude in the building industry. Under Turkish regulations updated in 2018, high-quality concrete has to be reinforced with ribbed, steel bars. The fines brought in billions of Turkish lira in taxes and fees. But when a residential building in Istanbul collapsed in 2019, killing 21 people, the head of the chamber of civil engineers said the amnesty would turn Turkish cities into graveyards."

But you do not really need to be an expert to see the consequences for Turkey in the latest Sentinel map. The Sentinel map will help scientists understand exactly what happened on Monday, and this knowledge will feed into their models for how earthquakes work in the region, and then ultimately into the risk assessments that the Turkish authorities will use as they plan the recovery.

Heavy machinery worked through the night in the city of Adana, with lights illuminating the collapsed buildings and huge slabs of concrete, in scenes repeated across southern Turkey. On Tuesday morning, traffic was at a standstill on the main highway to the Turkish city of Maras, close to the epicentre of the quake. Few rescuers have made it to this part of southern Turkey yet. Nationally, 8,000 people have been rescued from more than 4,700 destroyed buildings, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said in its latest statement. In Hatay, Ghanaian footballer Christian Atsu - who made 107 appearances for Newcastle - was pulled from the rubble of a building with injuries, his manager Mustafa Özat told Turkish radio. Atsu now plays for Turkish club Hatayspor. In the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, pouring rain hampered rescuers. But the earthquake has caused significant damage to three airports across Turkey, also creating challenges for aid deliveries. At least 1,600 people are now known to have been killed in Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on the Turkish border. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones."

Kitle Eikelberg is one of thousands among the UK's Turkish and Syrian communities in anguish as the quake's death toll rises above 5,000. British search and rescue specialists sent by the UK government are due to set to fly to Turkey today. Ms Eikelberg, from Richmond, London, said she had been told six distant relatives had died in Maksutusagi - the southern Turkish village she grew up in - during the earthquake, but her two elderly aunts and uncles managed to survive. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck near the Turkish town of Gaziantep in the early hours of Monday while people were asleep, before a 7.5 magnitude tremor hit later in the day. Ali Topaloglu, from the Nottingham Turkish Community, told the BBC his family had been directly affected. The chairman of the British Turkish Association said he had been ""inundated"" with calls from people worried about loved ones. Attila Ustun described it as a ""heartbreaking"" day for Turks everywhere and said there was ""a very large connection"" between the Turkish communities in east and north London and the area where the quake struck. Mr Ustun said people from Turkish backgrounds had been reaching out after learning family members had died, including ""one gentleman in Bedfordshire who has lost three of his uncles in one property"". The British Turkish Association is taking donations, particularly winter clothes, at different points across the UK. The UK government is sending a team of 76 search and rescue specialists to Turkey to help search for survivors. Development Minister Andrew Mitchell said the British team had been due to leave for Turkey on Monday night, but were delayed. David Wightwick, CEO of medical aid charity UK-Med, said he and his team were heading to Turkey on Tuesday morning to assess where their help is most needed, before mobilising their register of hundreds of NHS medics. ""The priority right now is rescuing people from the rubble and Red Cross Red Crescent teams are on the ground in Syria and Turkey providing urgent support during these critical hours."""

Seismologists said the first quake was one of the largest ever recorded in Turkey. The number of dead and injured from both Turkey and Syria has increased rapidly throughout Monday. Many of the victims are in war-torn northern Syria, where millions of refugees live in camps on both sides of the border with Turkey. The BBC's Middle East correspondent Anna Foster, reporting from the Turkish city of Osmaniye, near the epicentre, described a devastating scene. Turkey's energy infrastructure has also been damaged, and videos have emerged showing large fires in southern Turkey. Turkey's energy minister Fatih Donmez confirmed there had been serious damage to the infrastructure, but did not mention the explosions. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones. The country's worst earthquake disaster was in 1939 when 33,000 people died in Turkey's eastern Erzincan province. The Turkish Red Crescent has called for citizens to make blood donations, and the organisation's president, Kerem Kınık, said on Twitter that additional blood and medical products were being sent to the affected region. Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support. The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered help to both Turkey and Syria, as has Iran. Turkey's interior minister, Suleymon Soylu, said 10 cities were affected by the initial quake including Hatay, Osmaniye, Adiyaman, Malatya, Sanliurfa, Adana, Diyarbakir and Kilis. A volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas of north-western Syria, fought back tears as he described the devastation in Sarmada, near the border with Turkey."

Some of the fortifications in the ""east, south and south-east"" of the castle had been destroyed by the earthquake, Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu has been reported as saying, adding that ""debris was scattered on the road"". It also saw changes made during the reign of the Ayyubids in the 12th and 13th Centuries, as well as the Ottoman Empire, and played an important role during Turkey's war of independence of the early 20th Century.

The tremors of the main quake - which happened at 04:17 local time - were felt more than a hundred miles in each direction from the epicentre - across southern Turkey and in northern Syria. BBC News has been piecing together what happened as the tremors struck and reverberated across Turkey and Syria - using personal testimony and social media posts which we have verified. In one verified tweet a camera pans across smoke-filled scenes of rubble and destruction in Iskenderun, southern Turkey. BBC Turkish spoke to earthquake survivors from different cities - all of them said it was the first time they had experienced such severe and long-lasting tremors. Videos have emerged showing large fires in southern Turkey, with people claiming the earthquake has caused gas pipelines to burst and burn out of control.

But one elderly man shopping for groceries in a street market in Istanbul was unimpressed. But Global Source Partners Turkey consultant Atilla Yesilada believes that inflation will eat into the pay rises too soon. A decision is likely to come on 13 February and many expect they will choose Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP). Another much-discussed figure is Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Soner Cagaptay from The Washington Institute think tank believes any attempt to ban the mayor of Istanbul from political life could backfire. He points out that President Erdogan himself was in a very similar situation in the 1990s - a popular and successful mayor of Istanbul who was banned from politics by Turkey's secular courts. It is Turkey's third-biggest party that could play the role of kingmaker. In January its state funding was cut off by Turkey's top court and it could even be banned for alleged links to Kurdish militants. If the presidential race goes to a second round, the HDP's support will most probably determine Turkey's next president. Article 101 in the Turkish constitution states that ""a person may be elected as president of the republic for two terms at most"". For Mr Erdogan, who has led Turkey since 2003, first as prime minister and later as directly elected president, the vote will decide whether his rule will go into a third decade."

His comments come days after Turkey suspended talks to accept the two Nordic nations as members. Their application must be unanimously approved by all current Nato members, but Turkey and Hungary have failed to ratify their bids. In his speech, Mr Erdogan suggested Turkey might now ""give a different response concerning Finland,"" adding that ""Sweden will be shocked"". Sweden has a larger Kurdish diaspora than Finland, and its talks with Ankara over Nato membership have been heated. Turkey has called on Sweden to distance itself from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. In response, Sweden approved a constitutional amendment which allows it to create tougher anti-terror laws demanded by Turkey. Both Sweden and Finland have also lifted bans on the sale of military equipment to Turkey, introduced after Ankara's military intervention in Syria in 2019. But Turkey has heavily criticised Sweden over recent protests in Stockholm, including one by a Kurdish support group which hung an effigy of Mr Erdogan from a lamp-post. Earlier this month, Mr Erdogan said Turkish elections had been brought forward by a month to 14 May. Helsinki's Foreign Minister, Pekka Haavisto, has since suggested the ""pressure"" of the looming ballot has caused discussions to become ""heated"" within Turkey and that negotiations should be paused."

A series of controversial protests in Sweden, including the burning of a Quran, have angered Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in recent days. As Turkey is already a member of Nato, it can block applications to join. Turkey said the Swedish government's decision not to prevent Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, from burning a copy of Islam's holy book in public was ""completely unacceptable"". Talks between the countries have stalled over a number of issues - including Turkey's demands that the Nordic nations deport those it views as terrorists - and look to be on hold until after Turkish elections in mid-May. Turkey is also calling on Sweden to distance itself from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. Turkey also wants other political concessions, including the deportation of critics of Mr Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Exacerbating tensions further, on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkish elections had been brought forward by a month to 14 May. Mr Haavisto said the ""pressure"" of the looming ballot has caused discussions to become ""heated"" within Turkey, suggesting Turkey's government may be taking a more hardline stance against Sweden's support of the YPG and the protests which have also seen an effigy of the president hung upside down, in a bid to garner support."

Sweden applied to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine - but needs Turkey, already a member, to approve. Responding to Mr Erdogan's remarks on Monday, Mr Billstrom said that he wanted to understand exactly what the Turkish leader said before commenting. ""Sweden will respect the agreement that exists between Sweden, Finland and Turkey regarding our Nato membership,"" he added.

Turkey, which had appealed to Sweden to stop the protest, earlier called off a visit by Sweden's Defence Minister, Pal Jonson, saying the trip had ""lost its significance and meaning"". It was hoped the trip could dispel Ankara's objections to the Scandinavian country joining the Nato military alliance. Turkey has so far held up both Sweden and Finland's Nato applications. Turkey wants political concessions, including the deportation of critics of its President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Turkey is already a Nato member, which means it can block another country from joining. Rasmus Paludan, a politician from the Danish far-right Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, burnt a copy of the Quran during the protest on Saturday afternoon outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm. Turkey is a majority Muslim country. Separate protests both in support of and against Turkey were also held in Stockholm. After Turkey cancelled the Swedish defence minister's trip, Mr Jonson tweeted: ""Our relations with Turkey are very important to Sweden, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue on common security and defence issues at a later date."""

Turkey still needs to approve Sweden's application - and has made that conditional on Stockholm cracking down on groups that Turkey describes as terrorists, including those it blamed for the effigy. A Swedish minister branded the stunt as ""deplorable"", but Turkey said the condemnation was not enough. Images of the hanged effigy of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan near Stockholm City Hall were published on Wednesday by a pro-Kurdish group called the Swedish Solidarity Committee for Rojava. Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu blamed the stunt on the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia - both of which Ankara calls terror groups. Sweden has vowed to distance itself from both groups in order to gain Turkish support for its Nato bid, which has faced months of delays. Turkey has said Sweden's new centre-right coalition government, which is backed by a far-right party, has been ""more determined"" and easier to work with than the previous one, but the protest has triggered fury. Turkey has summoned the Swedish ambassador over the incident and cancelled a visit to Ankara by Sweden's parliamentary Speaker. And prosecutors in the Turkish capital have launched an investigation, according to Anadolu news agency. The member of the group added that Turkey had not reacted in a way a democratic country should."

Dr Sebnem Korur Fincanci was sentenced to nearly three years in jail but under Turkish law is eligible for release. Ms Fincanci, a forensic specialist and a leading human rights activist, was arrested after calling for an independent investigation into claims that the Turkish military used banned chemical weapons against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq. The PKK, which the EU and the US regard as a terrorist organisation, released video in October that it said showed Turkish troops releasing a substance into a cave as well as its effects on a male and female fighter. The Turkish government strongly denied using chemical weapons against the PKK and Ms Fincanci was accused of spreading terrorist propaganda and insulting Turkey. However, people are rarely imprisoned in Turkey for jail sentences under three years. Supporters of Ms Fincanci chanted ""this is only the beginning, we will carry on fighting"" and ""the Turkish Medical Association will not be silenced"". Emma Sinclair, the head of Human Rights Watch in Turkey, said she is glad that Ms Fincanci is being freed but that her case ""sends a strong message to everyone to be silent."" Ms Sinclair added that she feared for other board members of the Medical Association of Turkey (TTB), who could face similar action if found to be members of a terrorist organisation. Turkey last year adopted a new media law requiring jail terms of up to three years for disseminating false information about Turkish security that would trigger ""fear and disturb public order"". Amnesty International described the law as ""another dark day for online freedom of expression and press freedom in Turkey"". The Turkish justice system has also drawn ire from some Western countries. Turkey says its courts operate independently, but the US State Department has been highly critical of Turkish justice in the past saying there is ""continued judicial harassment of civil society, media and political leaders"" - particularly in the wake of the life sentence given to prominent philanthropist and campaigner Osman Kavala last April. Last October, Turkey introduced a ""disinformation law"" allowing those accused of spreading ""false news"" to be jailed for up to three years."

The pro-Kurdish HDP is accused of ties to militant groups who've carried out attacks in Turkey, and of financing their activities. Ankara's Constitutional Court blocked the party's share of treasury money used to finance its electoral campaign. This had been reported by Turkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency. The HDP was expected to receive 539m Turkish lira ($28.7m; £24.1m) in state grants this year, with around a quarter of that due to be paid this month. Each of the four parties in Turkey's parliament receives a share of the state grant. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is fighting to keep his job as Turkey's president, which he's held since 2014. A weakened Turkish economy - exacerbated by financial decisions made by President Erdogan - means he's lost the support of many voters ahead of crucial elections, expected to be held in June. In the last election, the HDP won more than 10% of the Turkish vote. Known as the PKK, the group is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU and the United States. This latest court decision is seen by many in Turkey as a significant marker in favour of the HDP's activities being permanently suspended. ""Only a few days before the distribution of the treasury's aid the Constitutional Court has accepted this request and given such a decision,"" she told journalists gathered at the party's headquarters in Istanbul. ""The only difference between then and now is that Turkey is heading towards elections,"" he added."

Imamoglu, 52, beat a candidate from Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan's AK Party to claim the city's mayoralty. Imamoglu went on to win again when fresh elections were held in June 2019 by polling 770,000 more votes than his rival - ending 25 years of AKP rule in Turkey's largest city. Supporters of the mayor gathered outside Istanbul's council buildings shouting ""government resign"" and ""truth, law and justice""- after Imamoglu called for people to gather and show their support. Imamoglu is expected to appeal against the sentence and will continue in post, but the possibility he may be disqualified from standing in the presidential election will make it harder for Turkey's opposition parties to choose a candidate to take on Mr Erdogan. Polls show the mayor of Istanbul is among a handful of opposition leaders who could beat the long-standing president in a head-to-head race."

Turkey has blamed Kurdish groups for a recent deadly bomb attack in Istanbul. The US defence department said the Turkish attacks had ""directly threatened the safety of US personnel"" working in Syria to defeat jihadist group Islamic State (IS). The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed militia alliance dominated by the YPG, has accused Turkey of using the Istanbul bombing as a pretext to launch a long-planned cross-border offensive. The Turkish military has launched three large-scale operations with allied Syrian rebel groups in northern Syria since 2016 and currently controls a swathe of territory running along more than 325km (200 miles) of the border. The most recent operation, in 2019, saw Turkey capture the area between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain before Russia brokered a ceasefire. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group, insisting that it is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The PKK has also denied involvement in the Istanbul bombing, which killed six people in the city's central Istiklal Avenue on 13 November. In a speech to members of his AK Party in parliament on Wednesday, President Erdogan said Turkey's determination to secure its border with Syria and establish a ""security corridor"" was ""stronger than ever before"". SDF commander Mazloum Abdi told Al-Monitor that he believed his hometown of Kobane would be the ""true target"" of any ground assault and alleged that the Istanbul attack was ""perpetrated by Syrian opposition groups operating under Turkey's control"". Mr Abdi also said Russia and the US were not doing enough to deter Turkey. Russia, an ally of the Syrian government, has warned Turkey that a full-scale ground offensive could trigger an escalation of violence. ""We hope our arguments will be heard in Ankara and other ways of resolving the problem will be found,"" Russian negotiator Alexander Lavrentyev said on Wednesday following talks in Kazakhstan. The US, a Nato ally of Turkey, warned about the impact any escalation could have on the goal of fighting Islamic State."

Later on Sunday a rocket fired from Syria reportedly injured three people on the border with Turkey, Turkish state media said. The strikes come a week after a bombing on one of Istanbul's busiest streets which killed six people and injured more than 80. Turkish authorities blamed the bombing on the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which Turkey, the EU and US regard as a terrorist organisation. Before the arrest, the Turkish justice minister said a bag had exploded near a bench after a woman sat there for 40 minutes. Kurdish militants have been battling for decades to achieve Kurdish self-rule in south-east Turkey.

Between 2015 and 2017 more than five hundred people were killed in attacks in Turkey by Islamist militants and Kurdish separatists. Turkey's Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said initial findings showed the PKK Kurdish separatist group was behind Sunday's attack, though no organisation has yet claimed responsibility. He promised Turkey would ""retaliate soon"" against whoever carried out the bombing. The blast has created a fresh nervousness on the streets of Istanbul.

However, the UN, Turkey and Ukraine continued sending ships even after Russia halted its support for the deal. The deal was brokered by the UN and Turkey in July, bringing to an end a five-month Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports that trapped millions of tonnes of grain and sunflower oil and sent food prices soaring. Under the agreement, ships are allowed to sail through a safe corridor before being inspected by a special co-ordination team in Turkey and then heading on through the Bosphorous Strait. Four days after Russia suspended its part in the deal, its U-turn was revealed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after a call between Russia's defence minister and his counterpart in Ankara. The UN official co-ordinating the grain deal, Amir Abdulla, praised Turkey's role in the talks and welcomed Russia's decision. A day before the Russian change of heart, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had spoken to the Turkish leader insisting on a thorough investigation into the attack on the Black Sea fleet before the grain deal could resume."

Sebnem Korur Fincanci is suspected of spreading terrorist propaganda and insulting Turkey, prosecutors say. Turkey denies using chemical weapons against the PKK, which the EU and the US regard as a terrorist organisation. Last week the militant group released video that it said showed Turkish troops releasing a substance into a cave as well as its effects on a male and female fighter. The jailed head of Turkey's pro-Kurdish HDP party, Selahattin Demirtas, agreed with her that there should be an investigation. The defence ministry in Ankara said Turkey's armed forces did not use ammunition prohibited by international law and aides of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised Ms Fincanci for repeating the allegation. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to take measures against both the Turkish medical association and its chairwoman, whom he accused of speaking the language of the PKK. On Tuesday, police detained 11 journalists in raids in several Turkish cities on suspicion of links to Kurdish militants. Turkey recently adopted a new media law requiring jail terms of up to three years for disseminating false information about Turkish security that would trigger ""fear and disturb public order"". Amnesty International described the law as ""another dark day for online freedom of expression and press freedom in Turkey""."

Greece laid the blame at Turkey's door, saying its ""behaviour"" was a ""shame for civilisation"". Turkey branded its neighbour's claims as ""fake news"" and accused it of ""cruelty"". Greek police said they rescued the 92 men who were discovered naked, and some with injuries, close to its northern border with Turkey on Friday. They said an investigation by them and officials from the EU border agency Frontex, found evidence that the migrants crossed the Evros river into Greek territory in rubber dinghies from Turkey. Greek minister for civil protection, Takis Theodorikakos, accused Turkey of ""instrumentalising illegal immigration"" in the latest in a row over migration between the neighbours. Speaking on Greek television he claimed that many of the migrants had told Frontex that ""three Turkish army vehicles had transferred them"" to the river which acts as a border between the two countries. ""One would expect a working explanation from the Turkish government's side,"" Mr Theodorikakos said. A day earlier, Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said in a tweet that Turkey's treatment of the migrants was a ""shame for civilisation"". He said Athens expected Ankara to investigate the incident and ""protect... The dispute has reached the highest level of government in Turkey, with tweets on behalf of the president denying any responsibility for what had happened and blaming Greece for the ""inhuman"" situation. The discovery of the men comes days after a leaked report by an EU agency criticised some senior staff at Frontex for covering up illegal pushbacks of migrants by Greece to Turkey, something Athens denies. Last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used a UN address to accuse Greece of transforming the Aegean Sea into a ""cemetery"" and said it had ""oppressive policies"" on immigration. Greece was on the frontline of a European migration crisis in 2015 and 2016, when around a million refugees fleeing war and poverty in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan arrived in the country, mainly via Turkey. The number of arrivals has fallen since then, but Greek authorities said they had recently seen an increase in attempted arrivals through the Turkish land border and the Greek islands."

Last year Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan took the unorthodox step of cutting interest rates to try to boost the economy. Last year's cut in interest rates from 19% to 14% has led to a fall in the value of the Turkish lira, which means it costs more for the country to import goods from abroad. US Banking giants JP Morgan said Turkey's inflation would remain in the ""abnormally high range until policies get orthodox"". ""We will build the century of Turkey together, hopefully by overcoming the inflation issue,"" said Mr Erdogan in a televised address on Monday. The record high is the sharpest inflation surge since World War Two, according to former Turkish central bank chief economist Hakan Kara."

This Turkish-made weapon had already proved its effectiveness in helping Azerbaijan defeat Armenian armoured forces and snatch back extensive territory in the Nagorno-Karabakh war of 2020. And that is where the Turkish drones come in, providing Togo - like Niger - with its own national aerial surveillance capacity to try to spot bands of militant fighters and, potentially, strike against them. For both Togo and Niger the supply partnership with Turkey is also politically useful, reducing their public reliance on close security partnerships with France, the former colonial power, about which a significant strand of domestic opinion remains uneasy. From Ankara's point of view there are also attractions: ""drone diplomacy"" and military partnership have become a significant tool in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's foreign policy outreach south of the Sahara, complementing more long-standing strengths such as the building of airports and other key infrastructure. And within the Turkish politico-business elite there is a personal connection too."

So who does Turkey want and could they ever be deported to Ankara? Turkey was the only one of Nato's 30 member states to block their bids until the two Nordic states agreed to a set of demands - including handing over individuals with alleged terror links. Under a memorandum signed at a Nato summit last week, Finland and Sweden agreed to address Turkey's ""pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly"", with ""bilateral legal frameworks to facilitate extradition"". Pro-government Turkish daily Hurriyet published a list of 45 people, including 33 sought from Sweden and 12 from Finland. Turkey is particularly keen on the handover of individuals it considers linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terror group by the EU, US and UK. It is also after followers of exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulenists are blamed by Turkey for a failed coup against President Erdogan in 2016. The BBC has spoken to three of the people sought by Turkey. For years, he was editor-in-chief of Today's Zaman, a major English-language daily in Turkey, before it was shut down in 2016. Turkish authorities accuse him of being part of the Gulen movement, or what they call the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation (Feto). Insulting President Erdogan remains a common charge today, with 17 journalists and cartoonists put on trial in the first three months of 2022, according to independent Turkish organisation Bianet.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62035768,Prices in Turkey rise at fastest pace for 24 years,4 Jul 2022,"Prices in Turkey are rising at their fastest rate in 24 years, according to the latest official figures. Inflation has surged since last year, when the Turkish president cut interest rates to try to boost the economy. Last year's cut in interest rates from 19% to 14% has led to a fall in the value of the Turkish lira, which means it costs more for the country to import goods from abroad. The overall inflation figure was the highest since September 1998, when annual inflation hit 80.4% and Turkey was battling to end a decade of chronically high inflation. As inflation in Turkey continues to smoulder, the nation's economy is also contending with the effects of a plunging currency value. The Turkish lira has shed nearly half its value in the past year. This is the second month in a row official data has missed forecasts, and that is continuing to stoke concern about the reliability of official data from Turkey's statistics agency. While times are tough for people living and working in Turkey, favourable exchange rates are helping lure international travellers to the country for summer holidays. But Turkish holidaymakers are coming in fewer numbers than in the past, and to afford it, they're staying fewer days and paying off the cost of travel over 10-12 months. ""Turkish people are trying to come on holiday."

Turkey would ask them to ""fulfil their promises"", the justice minister said. Ankara has accused both Finland and Sweden of hosting Kurdish militants. The Nordic states agreed late on Tuesday to ""address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously"". Turkey initially threatened to veto their application but after four hours of talks at the Nato summit in Madrid the three countries reached a compromise. He called on Finland to hand over six members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and another six from the movement of exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. Turkey also wants 11 PKK members and 10 Gulenists to be extradited from Sweden. The PKK, formed in the late 1970s, launched an armed struggle against the Turkish government in 1984, calling for an independent Kurdish state within Turkey. Meanwhile, the Gulenists are blamed by Turkey for a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. Finland and Sweden have so far made no public comments on the Turkish request. They also promised not to support the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its military wing, the People's Protection Units (YPG) - which Ankara insists is an extension of the PKK. The two countries also pledged to lift their restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey. Magdalena Andersson looked visibly happy in the Madrid sunshine as she told Swedish Television's morning show that she'd slept well after the ""big day"" that saw Turkey finally sanctioning a Nato spot for Sweden and Finland. She's become something of a global political celebrity in recent weeks, appearing on international TV channels to argue Sweden shouldn't make concessions to Turkey, which she's described as an Islamist dictatorship.

Most Turks already know their country as Türkiye. However the anglicised form Turkey is widely used, even within the country. Onur Erem, BBC Turkish service So for an English-speaker, changing the first vowel of Turkey to a Ü and adding an E to the end (as in pet) is enough to pronounce the new name perfectly. President Erdogan was pushing for this move for years, arguing that the country would be better represented with the Turkish name instead of sharing the same word with a bird. Turkey the bird is called by a different name in many languages, such as ""peru"" in Portuguese, while in Turkish it is ""hindi"".

Mr Erdogan accused Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of seeking to block the sale of American-made F-16 fighter jets to Turkey while visiting the US. The row comes amid Turkey's threats to block a proposed expansion of Nato. Ankara has accused Finland and Sweden of harbouring members of Kurdish militias that it says pose a risk to Turkey. Tensions have been growing between the Mediterranean neighbours after Mr Mitsotakis urged a joint session of the US Congress not to drop a ban on Turkey's membership of a purchasing programme for the next generation F-35 fighter jet last week. The Biden administration has reportedly been considering dropping the ban, imposed after Ankara purchased an S-400 air defence system from Russia in 2019. Mr Erdogan said this amounted to lobbying US officials against Turkey and violated an agreement ""not to involve third countries"" in disputes between Ankara and Athens. The Turkish President also announced a planned summit with Mr Mitsotakis later this year had been cancelled, pledging to ""never agree to have a meeting"" with the Greek leader. While Greece and Turkey are nominally Nato allies, the two have a tense relationship that has regularly threatened to break out into open conflict.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59681825,Turkey cuts rates despite spiralling inflation,17 Dec 2021,"Turkey has cut interest rates again, despite red hot inflation and a worsening currency crisis. In a statement, Turkey's bank compared its decision to those of other major Western central banks, which have kept rates low during the coronavirus pandemic to help boost economic growth. Economic growth is still high here: Turkey is considered an emerging market, and the past few decades have been powered by credit-fuelled growth in sectors like construction. Over the past year, it has become increasingly difficult for Turks to plan, save, or spend money on everyday goods and services. Protests have been breaking out in the capital Ankara and in the biggest city of Istanbul. The president and his allies says that lower interest rates will boost Turkish exports, investment and jobs."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59487912,Why currency crash does not worry Turkey's Erdogan,3 Dec 2021,"Turkey's national currency has plummeted 45% against the dollar this year and yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan doesn't seem all that bothered. The lira has flirted with record lows this week, but Turkey's long-time leader is pressing ahead with his ""economic war of independence"", backed up by low interest rates. So why is Mr Erdogan pushing a model that critics warn risks soaring inflation, higher unemployment and poverty, and what does it mean for Turks? The simple reason for the Turkish lira's collapse is his unorthodox economic policy of keeping interest rates low to boost Turkey's economic growth and export potential with a competitive currency. Annual inflation has surged above 21% in Turkey, but the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, overhauled by Mr Erdogan, has just lowered interest rates from 16% to 15%, the third cut this year. Turkey's economy is heavily dependent upon imports for producing goods from foods to textiles, so the rise of the dollar against the lira has a direct impact on the price of consumer products. Take the tomato, a vital ingredient in Turkish cuisine. ""How can we make money out of this?"" asks Sadiye Kaleci, who farms grapes in Pamukova, a small town three hours' drive from Istanbul. A bakery in Turkey's third city, Izmir, put up a sign explaining its higher prices by listing surging costs of ingredients such as flour, oil and sesame, signing off with the message: ""May God be with us."" But the most visible display of public dissent is among younger Turks on Twitter, Twitch live streams, TikTok videos and YouTube. One in five young people in Turkey is out of work; it is even worse among women. Turkey has the world's fourth highest rate of youth not in employment, education or training, according to the OECD. Turkey's youth compare their living standards with those in other countries and do not like what they see. This generation is poised to play an important role in politics in Turkey, ruled by Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) since 2002."

""The way Turkey is being governed at the moment does not look like a real democracy."" His continued detention has put Turkey on a collision course with its Western allies, and with the Council of Europe - something that Turkey's combative leader does not appear to mind. Ultimately, this could lead to Turkey being expelled from the 47-nation human rights body. ""They want to convict Turkey regarding this Soros leftover.

Turkish media reported last Friday that the Oknins and a Turkish citizen were arrested after staff at a restaurant in the Camlica TV and Radio Tower, on the Asian side of Istanbul, told police that they had been taking pictures of Mr Erdogan's residence. An Israeli lawyer for the couple rejected the allegations and said they had merely photographed the waterfront Dolmabahce Palace, on Istanbul's European side, during a boat trip.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59133076,Why Turkey is deporting Syrians over banana jokes,2 Nov 2021,"Laughing and joking on camera, Syrians have been taking part in the latest craze to sweep social media in Turkey. In recent days, Turkish authorities have accused Syrians of ""inciting hatred"" for eating bananas in a ""provocative"" way. In a climate of increasing hostility towards Turkey's large Syrian community, bananas have became a symbol of division. The banana challenge was inspired by a viral video of a heated discussion between Syrians and Turks about the dire economic situation in Turkey. Turkey's economy has suffered from high inflation that has eroded living standards. In the video, conflicting views were shared and a young Syrian woman, in fluent Turkish, defended the work ethic of refugees. In response, frustrated Turks suggested Syrians and Afghans were taking their jobs. Such opinions are not uncommon in Turkey, which hosts the world's largest refugee population, including 3.6 million Syrians. Anti-migrant sentiment has been rising, with a number of nationalist Turkish politicians campaigning for harsher restrictions. But what made this video go viral was what one Turkish man said: ""I see Syrians in the bazaar buying kilograms of bananas, I myself cannot afford them."" This claim, which caused debate among the Syrian community in Turkey, quickly turned into a viral soundbite on TikTok. Poking fun at the Turkish man, Syrians filmed themselves eating bananas, using banana filters, and sharing banana memes. One photo that replaced the Turkish flag with a banana particularly rankled. The newly founded nationalist Victory Party issued a complaint against Syrian TikTok users for ""insulting the Turkish people and their flag"". Other critics on social media said the videos were ""mocking the grave economic situation Turks are facing"". At a time of economic woe, the banana videos apparently irked Turkish authorities, too. Last Thursday, local media said Turkish police had arrested 11 Syrians who published banana videos, accusing them of ""provocation and inciting hatred"". The Turkish Migration authority said it would ""deport them after the necessary paperwork is taken care of"". Efforts were being made to ""uncover all the provocative posts"" and deal with ""all individuals who participated in this campaign"", Turkey's Directorate General of Migration said."

Turkey and Qatar are closer to the region's Islamist movements, which frequently creates tension with powers like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who see such groups as an existential threat. For Qatar and Turkey, contact with the Taliban developed in different ways. Turkey, which has strong historical and ethnic ties in Afghanistan, has been on the ground with non-combat troops as the only Muslim-majority member of the Nato alliance there. Turkey is also an ally of neighbouring Pakistan, from whose religious seminaries the Taliban first emerged. Last week, Turkish officials held talks with the Taliban lasting over three hours, as chaos gripped Kabul airport. Some of the discussions were about the future operation of the airport itself, which Turkish troops have guarded for six years. The Taliban had already insisted Turkey's military leave along with all other foreign forces to end Afghanistan's ""occupation"". He added: ""Turkey is ready to lend all kinds of support for Afghanistan's unity but will follow a very cautious path."" Prof Ahmet Kasim Han, an expert on Afghan relations at Istanbul's Altinbas University, believes dealing with the Taliban provides President Erdogan with an opportunity. He says Turkey may try to position itself as ""guarantor, mediator, facilitator"" - as a more trusted intermediary than Russia or China - who have kept their embassies open in Kabul. ""Turkey can serve that role,"" he says. But Turkey is among those in a stronger position to develop ties on the ground; albeit a situation that is full of risk. ""They consider Turkey as a country with a manifest destiny - an exceptional position within the Muslim world. It is based on Turkey's past and its Ottoman heritage as the seat of the caliphate."" ""However, if that role amounts to a point where any country including Turkey becomes the sponsor... Turkey should not want itself there,"" he adds. Mr Erdogan's move reportedly has more ""rational"" motives too - by improving Turkey's strained relations with the US and Nato, and building influence to prevent flows of Afghan refugees to Turkey."

Although Turkey came back strongly, Wales squandered a glorious opportunity to consolidate their lead when captain Bale ballooned a penalty over the bar. There were some nervous moments for the Welsh defence as they withstood Turkish attacks - with Danny Ward making a vital late save to deny Merih Demiral. Relive the action from Wales v Turkey, plus reaction But regardless of events in Rome, this impressive performance and result against Turkey - tipped by many before this tournament as potential dark horses - marked a remarkable transformation from Robert Page's side. With Bale swapping wings with Daniel James, an absolute menace for the Turkish defence, there was a purpose and pace to Wales' game which had been lacking in their opening fixture. Bale picked up possession near halfway, saw Ramsey's run in behind Turkey's defence and found his team-mate with an expertly measured chip. Fortunate not to be further behind but willed on by a vociferous, overwhelmingly Turkish-Azeri crowd, Turkey were set up in a far more attacking manner for the second half with full-backs and wingers pushing further upfield. That was one of several Turkish efforts in a period of intense pressure and, having withstood it, Wales were presented with a gift of a chance to extend their lead. Bale took on Mehmet Zeki Celik inside the penalty area and, as the Turkey right-back dangled his leg, pushed the ball ahead of him and was taken down. Turkey were not done yet - Demiral's powerful header was well saved by Ward with just three minutes left - but it was Wales who had the final say."

It was first found in Turkey in 2007 but has also been discovered in the Aegean Sea near Greece. Turkey's recent outbreak along large areas of the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, is believed to be the biggest in history and is causing havoc for local communities.

""Taksim Mosque now occupies a prominent place among the symbols of Istanbul,"" Mr Erdogan said after saying Friday prayers at the site. Mr Erdogan first talked about wanting a mosque in Taksim Square when he was the mayor of Istanbul in the 1990s. But while Turkey is a Muslim-majority country, critics have accused Mr Erdogan of actively trying to displace Turkey's secular basis.

He served several jail terms in Turkey. He fled Turkey last year to avoid prosecution, and was previously jailed for fraud and running a criminal group. According to Peker, Mr Soylu offered him protection and tipped him off last year, enabling him to flee Turkey before being arrested. Mr Soylu, a close associate of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, denied the claim and demanded that Peker return to face justice in Turkey. Last week Mr Erdogan said his AK Party had brought peace to Turkey by combating gangs such as Peker's and would ""foil this dirty script too"", Reuters news agency reported.

Greenpeace said about 40% - or 210,000 tonnes - of the UK's plastic waste exports were sent to Turkey last year. Greenpeace's report warned Turkey was becoming Europe's ""largest plastic waste dump"". The charity said it had investigated 10 sites across southern Turkey and found plastic bags and packaging from UK supermarkets and retailers at all of them. Turkey, Malaysia and Poland received the largest amounts of plastic waste exports from the UK in 2020. Last year, the dumping of plastic waste in Turkey was the subject of a BBC investigation. Turkey received nearly 40% of the UK's plastic waste exports in 2020 - an increase by a factor of 18 since 2016, when 12,000 tonnes were sent. European Union member states also sent 20 times more plastic waste to Turkey last year compared to 2016. Nihan Temiz Atas, biodiversity projects lead from Greenpeace Mediterranean, based in Turkey, said: ""Around 241 truckloads of plastic waste come to Turkey every day from across Europe and it overwhelms us. The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""We are clear that the UK should handle more of its waste at home, and that's why we are committed to banning the export of plastic waste to non-OECD countries and clamping down on illegal waste exports - including to countries such as Turkey - through tougher controls."

Travel agents say travellers from Pakistan are still arriving in Istanbul en route for the UK, and that while Turkish residents are meant to stay at home, tourists are still allowed to go sightseeing. The surge of cases in India, and to a lesser extent in Pakistan and Turkey, reminds us how connected our world is in the face of this pandemic. I suspect that during each of our three waves we exported the virus from Bradford to low-incidence countries, and this may well have contributed to subsequent outbreaks in Pakistan, India, Eastern Europe or Turkey."

Ankara is still proud of its relatively low total number of deaths, at around 39,000, and authorities say the pandemic is still under control, thanks to the country's strong healthcare system. But as soon as the government started to ease the restrictions in March, a new wave struck Turkey. Turkey mainly uses the Chinese Sinovac vaccine, as well as lower numbers of Pfizer-Biontech.

But the issue is highly sensitive, with Turkey acknowledging atrocities but rejecting the term ""genocide"". Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Saturday that Turkey ""entirely rejects"" the US decision. Later the Turkish foreign ministry said it had summoned the US ambassador to convey Ankara's ""strong reaction"". Previous US administrations have not used the term genocide in formal statements amid concerns over damaging relations with Turkey, a Nato ally. Ottoman Turks had accused Christian Armenians of treachery after suffering a heavy defeat at the hands of Russian forces and began deporting them en masse to the Syrian desert and elsewhere. Turkey estimates the total to be closer to 300,000. Although Turkish officials have accepted that atrocities took place, they argue that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people. Turkey says many Muslim Turks also died in the turmoil of World War One. But the Turkish foreign ministry responded angrily, saying in a statement they ""reject and denounce in the strongest terms the statement"", saying it had been ""made under the pressure of radical Armenian circles and anti-Turkey groups""."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16352745,Q&A: Armenian genocide dispute,24 Apr 2021,"The mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War One remains a highly sensitive issue. Turkey has resisted widespread calls for it to recognise the 1915-16 killings as genocide, while historians continue to argue about the events. At the time there were numerous reports of Turkish atrocities committed against the Armenians. There is general agreement that hundreds of thousands of Armenians died when the Ottoman Turks deported them en masse from eastern Anatolia and across the Ottoman empire to the Syrian desert and elsewhere in 1915-16. The Republic of Turkey estimates the total to be 300,000. In a 2005 letter to Turkey's then prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the IAGS said: ""We want to underscore that it is not just Armenians who are affirming the Armenian Genocide but it is the overwhelming opinion of scholars who study genocide."" Turkish officials accept that atrocities were committed but argue that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Christian Armenian people. Turkey says many Muslim Turks also died in the turmoil of war. The Young Turks - an officers' movement that had seized power in 1908 - launched a series of measures against Armenians as the Ottoman Empire was crumbling through military defeats in the war. The Young Turks - calling themselves the Committee of Unity and Progress (CUP) - had entered the war on Germany's side in 1914. Turkish propaganda at the time presented the Armenians as saboteurs and a pro-Russian ""fifth column"". Several senior Ottoman officials were put on trial in Turkey in 1919-20 in connection with the atrocities. The Young Turks' top triumvirate - the ""Three Pashas"" - had already fled abroad. Historians have questioned the judicial procedures at these trials, the quality of the evidence presented and the degree to which the Turkish authorities may have wished to appease the victorious Allies. US governments had held back for decades, partly because Turkey is the second-biggest military power in Nato and strategically vital for the West. Turkey reacted angrily after Pope Francis called it ""the first genocide of the 20th Century"" in the run-up to the centenary commemorations. Turkey recalled its Vatican ambassador and accused the Pope of having ""discriminated about people's suffering""."

He pointed in a Facebook post to Turkey's ""strict interpretation of the protocol rules...

Dutch Euro MP Sophie in 't Veld complained it was a deliberate slight by the Turks that ""puts into question the equal treatment"" of Mrs von der Leyen, and that it was not a coincidence she was the only woman in the room. It did not go unnoticed that Turkey's recent decision to pull out of the Istanbul convention on violence against women was on the agenda for Tuesday's talks. Iratxe García Pérez, leader of the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, said it was ""shameful"", with Turkey first leaving the Istanbul convention, then leaving the Commission president without a seat. Ties between Turkey and the EU have been strained for years, over the influx of migrants and recently over Turkey's drive for gas in the Eastern Mediterranean. After the meeting, Mrs von der Leyen held out hope of revising a 2016 deal under which the EU pays Turkey to prevent large-scale arrivals in Greece."

The trial coming to an end on Wednesday dates back to October 2017 and is described as the final case in the capital, Ankara. Most of those accused were members of Turkey's presidential guard regiment. Ever since the failed coup, Mr Erdogan has targeted Gulen supporters, with many Turks losing their jobs in the public sector as well as in the military on suspicion of support for the movement. Another 2,500 Turks have already been jailed for life in earlier cases. During the chaotic night of 15-16 July 2016, a section of the military blocked bridges over the Bosphorus in Istanbul, seized TV channels and targeted parliament while the president was on holiday. He soon succeeded in flying into Istanbul, his supporters took to the streets and within hours the coup was over. The failed coup continues to cast a shadow over Turkish public life, and particularly over President Erdogan's relationship with the military. When 104 retired admirals signed an open letter this week criticising a vast Istanbul canal project championed by the president, 10 of them were detained to face charges similar to those levelled against the coup-plotters.

Some Turkish opposition politicians accused the government of ""coup paranoia"". Last month the government approved plans for Canal Istanbul, which is to be about 45km (31 miles) long, running north to south through Istanbul, just west of the Bosphorus. The retired admirals raised fears that it could undermine the 1936 Montreux Convention, which granted Turkey control over the Bosphorus Strait within its borders, and set limits for commercial and naval shipping there. They wrote that ""any kind of discourse and activity"" that could open the convention up for discussion should be avoided, adding that it ""best protects Turkish interests"". It claims Turkish maritime rights in the Eastern Mediterranean, including waters around some Greek islands. Tensions have escalated in the past year, as Turkey is prospecting for oil and gas in the area. In the secular Turkish republic created by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk the military were seen as guardians of the secular order. In 2011 Mr Erdogan said ""we are rolling up our sleeves for Canal Istanbul, one of the greatest projects of the centuries, that will outshine the Panama and Suez canals"". Some argue that Turkey's struggling economy can ill afford it, that Istanbul needs better earthquake protection, and that the project will create more pollution in the crowded city of more than 15 million."
BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56516462,Women rise up as Turkey quits violence treaty,26 Mar 2021,"It has been a tumultuous and anxious week for women in Turkey. When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a decree at midnight last Friday, annulling Turkey's ratification of the Istanbul Convention on violence against women, women poured on to the streets of Turkish cities to protest. Among the protesters' slogans were ""Istanbul Convention saves lives"" and ""We don't accept one man's decision"". Women's rights activists, lawyers and opposition politicians have denounced Mr Erdogan's decree, insisting he cannot legally take Turkey out of an international convention ratified by parliament. Women are killed in Turkey every day and critics argue that this move puts women in even greater danger. According to Turkey's We Will Stop Femicide Platform, at least 300 women were murdered in 2020, mostly by their partners, and 171 more women were found dead under suspicious circumstances. Turkey was the first state to ratify the convention, by a unanimous vote in the parliament in 2012, and it was actively supported by the Women and Democracy Association (Kadem), whose vice-chair is President Erdogan's daughter. He even praised the convention at one point as evidence that Turkey was a leader in gender equality. President Erdogan's spokesperson, Fahrettin Altun, argued that the Istanbul Convention's original intention of promoting women's rights had been ""hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalise homosexuality"" and that it was incompatible with Turkey's social and family values. To quell the critics, senior AKP members announced they would deal with domestic violence through judicial reform and an Ankara Convention that would claim its power from ""traditions and customs"". The change further weakened the Turkish lira. Whatever the rationale may be, there is a sense that the man who has dominated Turkey since 2003 is seeking to consolidate his conservative support base as opinion polls signal discontent among voters. State prosecutors in Turkey are also moving to ban the country's third-largest party, the Kurdish-rooted Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP)."

The fallout from the sacking hit shares on the Istanbul stock exchange, and raised concerns about the impact Turkey's borrowing costs. After dropping sharply, the lira then recovered some ground to stand about 8% lower against the US dollar after Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan said Turkey would stick to free market rules. Last week, the Turkish currency rose strongly after Mr Agbal increased interest rates by 2 percentage points, double what economists expected. Investors have been calling for tighter monetary policy in Turkey to tame its high inflation rate, as prices rise rapidly in the country.

But Turkey said the Istanbul Convention - which seeks to prevent, prosecute and eliminate domestic violence - was incompatible with its family values. Women's rights activists say the Istanbul Convention was crucial to combating domestic violence in Turkey. Aside from Turkey, the treaty had only been ratified by 34 countries. ""Around the world, we are seeing increases in the number of domestic violence incidents, including reports of rising femicide in Turkey,"" Mr Biden said. The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Turkey was sending ""a dangerous message across the world"" about the rights of women. ""We therefore cannot but urge Turkey to reverse its decision,"" Mr Borrell said. ""This move is a huge setback to these efforts and all the more deplorable because it compromises the protection of women in Turkey, across Europe and beyond,"" Secretary-General Buric said. ""The Istanbul Convention, originally intended to promote women's rights, was hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalise homosexuality - which is incompatible with Turkey's social and family values. It said Turkey was not the only country that had ""serious concerns"" about the Istanbul Convention. Despite quitting the convention, the Turkish government ""will not give up on its fight against domestic violence"", the statement added. President Erdogan, who has dominated the country for nearly two decades, has been accused of eroding Turkey's secular character and promoting social conservatism. Conservative critics of the Istanbul Convention said it was being used to advocate for greater acceptance of the LGBT community in Turkey. The Human Rights Watch group says ""anti-LGBT policy has become a polarising tool for the Turkish government in its crackdown on opposition voices"". At least 300 women were murdered in the country last year, according to Turkey's We Will Stop Femicide Platform.

It signed the Council of Europe's convention 10 years ago at its launch in the Turkish city of Istanbul. But Turkish conservatives argue its principles of gender equality and non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation undermine family values and promote homosexuality. Turkey's decision was described as ""devastating"" for efforts to combat domestic violence by the head of Europe's top human rights body, the Council of Europe. ""This move is a huge setback to these efforts and all the more deplorable because it compromises the protection of women in Turkey, across Europe and beyond,"" Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric said. In Istanbul, people gathered for a demonstration under the slogan ""You'll never walk alone"". On social media, Turkey's minister for family, labour and social policies, Zehra Zumrut, said women's rights were protected by the country's constitution. She did not give a reason for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention, which is the world's first binding treaty to prevent domestic violence. Gokce Gokcen, deputy chairperson of Turkey's opposition Republican People's Party, tweeted that abandoning the convention meant ""keeping women [as] second class citizens and letting them be killed"". According to Turkey's We Will Stop Femicide Platform, at least 300 women were murdered in the country last year but the number could be even greater, with dozens more found dead in suspicious circumstances. The rape and murder of 23-year-old student Sule Cet in the capital Ankara in May 2018 struck a particular chord, prompting demonstrations and widespread media coverage. ""What's abolished tonight is not only the Istanbul convention but the parliament's will and legislative power,"" he was quoted as saying by AFP news agency."

The HDP, which is the third-largest party in Turkey's parliament, denies any links to the militants. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long accused the HDP of being a political front for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militant group. The PKK is recognised as a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its western allies, including the US and the European Union. It has been waging an insurgency against the Turkish government since 1984, calling for increased human rights and freedoms for the Kurds within the country. That pressure has only intensified since a failed 2016 coup against Mr Erdogan by a mutinous faction of Turkish army officers."

With the setting sun reflecting in the water and the lights of Istanbul twinkling on the horizon, the wedding guests sat around lantern-lit tables: diplomats from several countries, military officers, journalists and activists who had flown in from around the world to see James Le Mesurier get married. The couple lived in a traditional white wooden house overlooking the Marmara Sea on Buyukada island, off the coast of Istanbul. On 11 November 2019 at around 05:00, a worshipper on his way to morning prayers discovered James Le Mesurier's crumpled body lying on the cobblestones in a narrow alleyway in Istanbul. Turkish detectives questioned her and took her DNA and fingerprints before forensically scouring the scene. So when, in 2011, he was invited by Alistair Harris to move to Turkey and manage civil society projects across the border in Syria, he jumped at the chance. As head of the Istanbul office of Harris's organisation, Ark, one of the projects Le Mesurier's took on focused on training young Syrians to act as firefighters, ambulance drivers and rescuers. He brought them all together in one organisation and got them professionally trained by the Turkish earthquake rescue specialists, Akut. While rescue operations were taking place in Syria, Le Mesurier was in Istanbul, hundreds of miles away. Le Mesurier returned to Istanbul utterly depleted. Months after his return to Istanbul his head of finance, a Dutchman named Johan Eleveld, asked where the remaining cash had gone. The couple spent the evening of 10 November in their flat above the Mayday Rescue offices in central Istanbul. In the end, the Turkish police concluded that James's death was suicide."

Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. ""He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,"" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post. Despite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out. On 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival. Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said on 31 October 2018 that the journalist was suffocated almost as soon as entered the consulate, and that his body was dismembered and destroyed. Writing in the Washington Post on 2 November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared it had been established that Khashoggi ""was killed in cold blood by a death squad"" and ""that his murder was premeditated"". In March 2020, the Istanbul chief prosecutor formally charged Saad al-Qahtani, Ahmad Asiri and 18 other Saudi nationals with murder. Saudi Arabia rejected Turkey's extradition request, so all 20 men were put on trial in absentia in Istanbul in July 2020. Court-appointed Turkish lawyers representing the defendants said their clients denied the charges."

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55424251,Erdogan: Human rights court ruling 'hypocritical',23 Dec 2020,"Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has condemned an order by the European Court of Human Rights to free a jailed Kurdish political leader. Detained in 2016, Selahattin Demirtas was then jailed in September 2018 for four years and eight months for making and ""spreading terrorist propaganda"" for militants fighting the Turkish state. Demirtas was co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which in 2015 became the first pro-Kurdish party to enter Turkey's parliament by surpassing the required 10% of the vote. As joint leader of the left-wing party, Demirtas played a key role in extending its reach beyond Kurdish voters and attracting mainstream voters in western Turkey. But after a ceasefire broke down in 2015 between Turkey and the militant PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party], there was spate of attacks and Demirtas and several colleagues were then charged with links to the outlawed group. In its ruling, the European Court of Human Rights found that by detaining Demirtas Turkey had ""pursued the ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate"". It found no clear link between his speeches and terrorism offences and ruled that Turkey should take immediate measures to release him. Turkey's justification for his pre-trial detention had ""merely been cover for an ulterior political purpose, which was a matter of indisputable gravity for democracy"", it added. In a speech to his AK party in parliament, the Turkish president said the ECHR had defended a ""terrorist"" and only Turkish courts could rule on the Demirtas case. Meanwhile, in a separate Turkish court verdict on Wednesday, exiled journalist Can Dundar was given a 27-year jail term in absentia for aiding a terrorist organisation and espionage. Since Turkey's failed coup in 2016, authorities have been accused of clamping down on press freedom and shutting down critical news outlets."

The sanctions announced by the state department on Monday target Turkey's weapons procurement sector. The move was swiftly condemned by officials in Turkey and Russia. The US had already kicked Turkey out of its F-35 fighter jet programme over the purchase of the Russian-made missile system. ""The United States made clear to Turkey at the highest levels and on numerous occasions that its purchase of the S-400 system would endanger the security of US military technology and personnel and provide substantial funds to Russia's defense sector, as well as Russian access to the Turkish armed forces and defense industry,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. ""Turkey nevertheless decided to move ahead with the procurement and testing of the S-400, despite the availability of alternative, Nato-interoperable systems to meet its defense requirements,"" he continued. ""I urge Turkey to resolve the S-400 problem immediately in co-ordination with the United States,"" he said. ""Turkey is a valued ally and an important regional security partner for the United States, and we seek to continue our decades-long history of productive defense-sector co-operation by removing the obstacle of Turkey's S-400 possession as soon as possible."" The sanctions target Turkey's Defence Industries Directorate president Ismail Demir, and three other employees. Turkey's foreign ministry urged the US ""to reconsider this unfair decision as announced today"",  adding that Turkey ""stands ready to address this issue through dialogue and diplomacy in conformity with the spirit of alliance"". The ministry warned that US sanctions ""will inevitably negatively impact our relations, and (Turkey) will retaliate in a manner and time it sees appropriate"". Ankara argues that the Russian system was purchased after the US refused to sell US-made Patriot missiles. Turkish officials point to the fact that Greece - another Nato ally - has their own S-300, although that was not purchased directly from Russia. Turkey has the second-largest army in Nato, a 30-member military alliance."

""They dressed up like ninja[s], they want to make us get on a boat and send us back to Turkey,"" he is heard saying. There they were forced into life rafts and were left to drift towards Turkish territorial waters, he said.

The woman in the red sweater, who met Kostas Theodorou and his wife, can be seen getting off the boat, in a photo released by the Turkish coast guard.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-55238803,The Syrians used as 'cannon fodder' in Nagorno-Karabakh,10 Dec 2020,"Turkey and Azerbaijan deny that Syrian mercenaries were used in the recent offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh but four Syrians have told the BBC that after enlisting for sentry duties in Azerbaijan, they were unexpectedly thrown into battle on the front line. Both applied for the job through Turkish-backed rebel factions that make up what's known as the Syrian National Army, a force in northern Syria opposed to President Bashar al-Assad. It's estimated that somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 men signed up and travelled to Azerbaijan, via Turkey, on Turkish military transport aircraft. Although Azerbaijan and its ally Turkey deny the use of mercenaries, researchers have amassed a considerable amount of photographic evidence, drawn from videos and photographs the fighters have posted online, which tells a different story. Allegedly through Russian and Turkish-backed security firms, Syrians from both the rebel and government-held areas have been fighting in the civil war in Libya for the last year or more - and on different sides. A mercenary representing the internationally recognised Libyan government forces, supported by Turkey, told me he'd personally participated in the capture of former pro-Assad Syrian soldiers when driving back Russian-backed forces loyal to Gen Khalifa Haftar. Turkey has acknowledged that Syrian fighters are present in Libya, though has not admitted recruiting them. We have deep historical and close kinship ties to Libya and we want to see a political solution and in Libya now there is a chance for peace and talks,"" Turkey's ambassador to London, Umit Yalcin, told me. When I mentioned what the Syrian fighters had told me about Turkey's role in recruiting them to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh, he echoed Azerbaijan's official denials. Calling on 11 November for mercenaries in the conflict zone to be withdrawn, UN human rights experts said widespread reports indicated that Turkey had engaged in large-scale recruitment and transfer of Syrian men to Azerbaijan. Military analysts say that it was above all its superiority in the air, using Israeli and Turkish drone technology, that enabled Azerbaijan to achieve the victory it now claims."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned that Kurdish fighters in Syria will either lay down their weapons or “be buried”, amid hostilities between Turkiye-backed Syrian rebels and other armed groups since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. Following al-Assad’s ouster on December 8, Ankara has repeatedly insisted that the Kurdish YPG militia must disband, asserting that the group has no place in Syria’s future. Turkiye views the YPG militia – the main component of the United States-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militia, which has waged a rebellion against the Turkish state since 1984. The PKK is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkiye, the US and the European Union. Ankara has repeatedly called on its NATO ally Washington and others to stop supporting the YPG. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said this is not a surprising statement by Erdogan “as it is the official rhetoric of the Turkish government”. Since the YPG is considered “the Syrian branch of the PKK, Ankara believes that they should either lay down arms, or they should fight and they will be defeated,” Koseoglu said. Earlier, Turkiye’s defence ministry said the armed forces had killed 21 YPG-PKK fighters in northern Syria and Iraq. SDF commander Mazloum Abdi acknowledged last week the presence of PKK fighters in Syria for the first time, saying they had helped battle ISIL (also known as ISIS) fighters and would return home if a total ceasefire was agreed with Turkiye, a core demand from Ankara. Erdogan also said Turkiye would soon open its consulate in Aleppo, adding that Ankara expected an increase in traffic at its borders in the summer of next year as some of the millions of Syrian migrants it hosts begin to return to their homes."

Turkiye’s foreign minister has met with the head of Syria’s new administration, promising help with the political transition and rebuilding the war-torn country after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime. In their meeting in Damascus on Sunday, Turkiye’s Hakan Fidan and Syria’s de facto ruler Ahmed al-Sharaa stressed the need for unity and stability in Syria, as they called for the lifting of all international sanctions against the war-ravaged country. Photographs and footage shared by the Turkish ministry showed Fidan and al-Sharaa hug and shake hands, their meeting coming two days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Fidan would be going to Damascus to discuss the new structure in Syria. Addressing the news conference with al-Sharaa, Fidan said Turkiye “will continue to stand by your side … Hopefully the darkest days of Syria are behind [and] better days await us.” Fidan’s visit to Damascus came amid fighting in northeast Syria between Turkiye-backed Syrian fighters and the Kurdish YPG group, which Ankara regards as a terrorist organisation. Turkiye had for years backed rebels seeking to remove al-Assad, while also hosting millions of Syrian refugees it hopes will start returning home. Al Jazeera’s Resul Sardar, reporting from Damascus, said Turkiye has offered help to the new Syrian administration, “emphasizing the importance of keeping the state institutions up and running”. “Turkiye has been one of the main backers of the Syrian opposition since the uprising started in 2011."

Turkiye expects foreign countries to withdraw support for Kurdish fighters in Syria after the toppling of Bashar al-Assad, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says, as Germany warns against an escalation in fighting with Kurdish forces. Turkiye considers the YPG an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has long fought the Turkish state and is designated as a “terrorist” group by Ankara, Washington and the European Union. Ankara, alongside Syrian allies, has mounted several cross-border offensives against the SDF in northern Syria while repeatedly demanding that its NATO ally Washington halts support for the fighters. Hostilities have escalated since President al-Assad was toppled less than two weeks ago with Turkiye and Syrian groups it backs seizing the city of Manbij from the SDF on December 9, prompting the US to broker a fragile ceasefire. Erdogan told reporters that Turkiye wanted to see a new Syria in which all ethnic and religious groups can live in harmony. Later on Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told her Turkish counterpart that security for the Kurdish people is critical for Syria. “Security, especially for Kurds, is essential for a free and secure future for Syria,” she told journalists after meeting Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan while warning of the dangers of any “escalation” with Kurdish forces in Syria. Fidan told Baerbock that it was essential for Kurdish groups including the PKK and YPG to lay down their arms and dissolve, Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said. Meanwhile, a senior US diplomat said on Friday that Washington was urging a ceasefire between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF around the flashpoint Syrian city known as Kobane in Kurdish and Ain al-Arab in Arabic. “We are working energetically in discussions with Turkish authorities, also with the SDF."

Turkiye has hit back at claims by the United States that it agreed to a ceasefire with Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, and has vowed to continue working to clear them from the territory – a military operation that was launched after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A senior Turkish defence official on Thursday rubbished claims made by US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller that a Washington-brokered ceasefire between Turkish-backed rebels and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) around the Syrian city of Manbij had been extended until the end of this week. The SDF is supported by Washington in its fight against ISIL, but Ankara views it as a “terrorist organisation”, alleging links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a four-decade armed rebellion on Turkish soil. On Thursday, the Turkish official described Miller’s statement as “a slip of the tongue”, saying it was “out of the question” for Turkiye to talk to the SDF, a group spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which is seen an extension of the PKK. Turkiye regards the PKK, YPG and SDF as “terrorist” groups. The US and Turkiye’s Western allies also list the PKK as “terrorist”, but not the YPG and the SDF. Renewed fighting between Turkish-backed factions and Syrian Kurdish fighters comes more than a week after fighters led by opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppled Syria’s longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad. Reporting from Istanbul, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said that Turkiye believed it was up to the new Syrian administration to remove “foreign fighters” – an allusion to PKK members of the YPG –  from its territory. “Turkiye considers all those PKK ranks within the YPG as foreign fighters and the Turkish foreign minister said these foreign fighters … within the opposition factions should be out of Syria, especially as there is a new Syrian administration and a national army is expected to be established,” she said. If the new administration was unable to remove foreign fighters from its territory, Turkiye could potentially intervene, she added."

Turkish FM on post-Assad Syria: Strategy vs reality Turkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has denied a claim by incoming United States President Donald Trump that the toppling of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad was an “unfriendly takeover” by Turkiye. In remarks apparently praising Ankara, Trump told a news conference earlier this week that Turkiye was “very smart” and had carried out “an unfriendly takeover without a lot of lives being lost” in Syria. In an interview with Al Jazeera broadcast on Wednesday, the Turkish foreign minister said it would be “a grave mistake” to describe the current events in Syria as a takeover by Turkiye. The foreign minister also said the “last thing” that Turkiye wants is to be seen as the regional power that has final control of Syria, pointing to a culture of domination that had brought ruin to the region. “Not Turkish domination, not Iranian domination, not Arab domination, but cooperation should be essential,” he said. Asked about US media reporting on concerns that the Turkish military may be prepared to launch a major military offensive in Syria to crush Kurdish forces that are hostile to Turkiye, the foreign minister pointed to the YPG (People’s Protection Units) as an “essential threat” to his country. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) armed group is listed as a “terrorist organisation” by Turkiye and the West, and Fidan described the YPG as the PKK’s “extension” in Syria. “Unfortunately, our Western friends … turn a blind eye to this fact that the YPG is an extension of the PKK,” he said, adding that Ankara has been calling on Washington to cease its military support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG is the main fighting component. Fidan also said that Syria’s new government must tackle the issue of Kurdish forces in its territory, which would avert the need for Ankara to take action. Local witnesses have told the French news agency AFP that there has been an increase in the number of soldiers patrolling on the Turkish side of the border, but unusual military activity has not been evident."

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy and Somali President Mohamud arrived in Ankara earlier on Wednesday for the talks, which were the latest following two earlier meetings that made little progress. According to the text of the agreement released by Turkiye, the parties agreed “to leave behind differences of opinion and contentious issues, and resolutely move forward in cooperation towards common prosperity”. They will now initiate technical talks no later than the end of February, which are to be completed “within four months”, and continuing differences are to be dealt with ” through dialogue” and where necessary with the support of Turkiye. Speaking alongside Erdogan, his remarks translated into Turkish, Ethiopia’s Abiy said: “We have addressed the misunderstandings that have occurred over the past year.” Turkiye has been mediating between the two countries since July, leading discussions aimed at resolving their differences."

Turkiye, by contrast, has emerged as the winner from the 14-year-old Syrian civil war."

In a joint news conference following a meeting with his Iranian counterpart, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Ankara continues to support Syria’s territorial integrity, adding that there is a “need for compromise between the Syrian government and opposition”. Turkiye, which has supported opposition factions in Syria, on Monday rejected any suggestion that “foreign interference” was behind the offensive launched by the fighters in the country’s north. “It would be a mistake at this time to try to explain the events in Syria by any foreign interference,” the Turkish foreign minister said, blaming instead an absence of dialogue between opposition groups and the government of al-Assad."

The MHP leader, a close ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been a vociferous opponent of Kurdish demands for more rights. He has referred to Kurdish politicians as “terrorists,” accusing them of links to the PKK, an armed group that is listed as a “terrorist organisation” by Turkey and the West. The promise of new peace negotiations between Turkey and the Kurdish fighters who have waged a 40-year rebellion was called into question last month after an attack on an aerospace plant near the capital Ankara. TUSAS manufactures civilian and military aircraft, including unmanned drones that have been crucial in combating the PKK, which has fought a war against the Turkish state since the 1980s, as part of an effort to claim more autonomy for Kurds living in southeastern Turkey. DEM quickly made it clear that they opposed the TUSAS attack, condemning it and saying that it was “meaningful” that it took place “when Turkish society is talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue is emerging”. Following the Ankara attack, Turkey launched a wave of air strikes against the PKK in Iraq and Syria. The group has directed its operations in Turkey from northern Iraq’s Qandil Mountains since the late 1990s. The Turkish military has severely curtailed PKK activity inside Turkey in recent years through the establishment of dozens of bases on the Iraqi side of the border and cross-border air strikes. In northeast Syria, meanwhile, Turkey has also targeted the PKK-affiliated People’s Defence Units (YPG), which the United States has supported since 2015 in the fight against ISIL (ISIS), providing weapons and training. American support for the Kurdish armed group strained Turkey’s relations with the US. While Turkey does not recognise any separation between the PKK and YPG, most Western states have declined to list the latter as a “terrorist” group. Speaking after the TUSAS attack, Erdogan said the two PKK assailants had crossed into Turkey from Syria, implicating the YPG."

On Friday, Turkey’s Ministry of National Defence said it carried out air strikes for the second night in a row in northern Iraq, hitting 34 PKK targets in Hakurk, Gara, Qandil and Sinjar, destroying shelters, warehouses and other facilities. The overnight strikes followed a security meeting that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan chaired with key ministers and chiefs of the armed forces and intelligence agency in Istanbul. The Turkish government said earlier it had proof that the PKK, listed as a terror group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, was behind the attack. Turkish forces earlier struck 29 targets in northern Iraq and 18 in northern Syria following the attack on TUSAS, with Erdogan saying the perpetrators “infiltrated Turkey from Syria”, Turkish media reported on Friday. Speaking to reporters during his flight back to Turkey from Russia’s Kazan, where he attended the BRICS summit, the president pledged to “eradicate terrorism at its source” in Syria, adding that his country would continue the struggle against armed fighters until the end. On Friday, the Reuters news agency quoted security sources as saying Turkey’s National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) had hit a total of 120 PKK targets in Iraq and Syria since the attack near Ankara. Turkish drone strikes killed 27 civilians in north and east Syria in a 24-hour military escalation following the deadly attack, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said on Friday.

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday night, Turkish National Defence Minister Yasar Guler alleged the PKK had carried out the attack. Turkey’s extreme-left Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) is also on the radar, according to Koseoglu. A peace process between Turkey and the PKK broke down in 2015, and the group and its affiliates carried out a number of attacks in the years that followed, as the Turkish military and security forces conducted operations against the PKK in southeast Turkey, as well as in Iraq and Syria. The number of attacks in major Turkish cities has dropped sharply since 2017. “This is more of a message that the Turkish defence industry can be targeted and harmed”, said Omer Ozkizilcik, non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs. “Turkish drones are a major game changer in the Turkish counterterrorism effort. All security units in the country are on alert and Turkey’s chief public prosecutor office has launched a judicial investigation into the attack."

Turkish opposition leader Ozgur Ozel of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) released a statement condemning the attack and saying he “condemns terrorism, no matter who or where it comes from”. The main pro-Kurdish DEM party also condemned the attack, saying it was “noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue” with the PKK. The attack occurred as a major trade fair for the defence and aerospace industries was taking place in Istanbul, which was visited this week by Ukraine’s top diplomat.

Istanbul, Turkey – The news that Fethullah Gulen, widely believed in Turkey to be the mastermind behind the country’s 2016 coup attempt, had died had not yet reached Omer, a taxi driver heading towards Istanbul’s Fatih district. As word of Gulen’s death in the United States spread on a crisp autumn day, bystanders began gathering outside the Istanbul municipality building in Fatih – one of the epicentres of the violence during the coup attempt, a night widely regarded as a turning point in modern Turkish history. The memorial includes a depiction of protesters performing ablution – a ritual purification for Muslims – at a nearby fountain before confronting soldiers and tanks in response to a call by Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His followers in the armed forces were believed by the state to be behind the coup – a point of view widely shared in Turkey by government supporters and the opposition. Gulen went from being a preacher in western Turkey to the founder of an expansive movement that ran schools, charities and media organisations. Not far from the Fatih municipality headquarters, at Eski Kafa, one of the district’s many small coffee shops, several young men enjoying their afternoon Turkish coffee were already discussing Gulen’s death. “The second reason I’m satisfied is that his death might lead to some normalisation in Turkey regarding political issues. It changed the way Turkey operates.” The attempted coup left a deep mark on Fatih, Istanbul’s historic district, where most have a story about where they were that night. A memorial for all those killed stands at the centre of Fatih with photos of the dead, a marker for many of the first Turkish coup that ordinary citizens were able to prevent. “After the coup attempt, I went to Vatan Street, in front of the Istanbul police headquarters. Ahmet Faruk Yilmaz, a 29-year-old artist sipping his Turkish tea, hopes Gulen’s death will mark the collapse of his organisation."

Fethullah Gulen, the controversial Turkish cleric and ally-turned-foe of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has passed away at the age of 83. Within Turkey, however, he grew to be a notorious figure, accused by the government of running a criminal ring that infiltrated state institutions. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who confirmed Gulen’s death this morning, described the cleric as the head of a “dark organisation”, telling a news conference: “Our nation’s determination in the fight against terrorism will continue, and this news of his death will never lead us to complacency.” While not specifically Islamic institutions, the schools offered quality education to all students, many of whom went on to key positions in Turkey, including the judiciary, police, and bureaucracy. In 1999, Gulen left Turkey for the US, where he would remain. His allies said he had moved due to health reasons, but his critics suggested his departure from Turkey was more likely prompted by a government investigation into his activities, which were potentially undermining the government. The following year, Gulen was convicted in absentia of conspiring to overthrow the state through embedding civil servants, a conviction that would be cited as evidence against him after a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. This led to the rise of many Gulen followers into influential positions in the state apparatus as both camps sought to counter what they saw as the influence of the secular elite in Turkey’s military and judicial establishments. Erdogan blamed Gulen for orchestrating the resulting scandal, accusing the religious leader of seeking to use his network of institutions and highly placed officials to operate a “parallel state” within Turkey. Three years later, Erdogan again blamed Gulen for a coup attempt on July 16, when factions within Turkey’s armed forces attempted to oust Erdogan’s government and install a body of their own making, the Council for Peace at Home, in its place. While their efforts were unsuccessful, hundreds were killed in what was the bloodiest coup in Turkey’s modern history. Turkey made a number of extradition requests for Gulen, but none were granted, with US officials claiming a lack of evidence linking Gulen directly to the coup."

Gulen built a powerful Islamic movement in Turkey and beyond but spent his later years accused of orchestrating an attempted coup against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accusations which he denied. Known to his supporters as Hodjaefendi, or respected teacher, Gulen was born in a village in the eastern Turkish province of Erzurum in 1941. This influence also spread beyond Turkey’s borders to the Turkic republics of Central Asia, the Balkans, Africa and the West through a network of schools. Since then, Gulen’s movement has been systematically dismantled in Turkey and its influence has declined internationally. Gulen also became an isolated figure within Turkey, reviled by Erdogan’s supporters and shunned by the opposition which saw his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the republic. The Turkish government said its actions were justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by the coup. Gulen travelled to the US for medical treatment but remained there as he faced a criminal investigation in Turkey. Ankara long sought to have him extradited from the US."

A project to possibly supply Turkey with Eurofighter jets is an effort being driven by the United Kingdom and is in the early stages, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says. “There are certain projects that are just getting started, … one that the UK government is taking forward and for which negotiations have now begun,” Scholz said when asked about the issue at a news conference on Saturday in Istanbul with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Turkey is a member of NATO, and that’s why we always take decisions that lead to concrete deliveries,” Scholz said. Last year, Ankara said it was eager to acquire Eurofighter jets, but the talks have been slow to get off the ground, largely because of Berlin’s opposition to Turkey’s stance on the Gaza conflict. According to the German news magazine Der Spiegel, Berlin recently authorised major arms deliveries to Ankara, including anti-aircraft missiles worth several hundred million euros. This marks a clear change of direction after Germany drastically reduced its arms exports following Turkish offensives in Syria beginning in 2016. Erdogan acknowledged Scholz’s efforts to lift German restrictions on defence sales to Turkey. Germany had previously been a large-scale armaments supplier to Turkey, but in recent years, German weapons exports to Turkey have been lower. Sales to Turkey have been controversial in Germany partly due to some of the Turkish government’s international actions. After Turkey’s initial ground offensive in northern Syria in 2016, German export permits to Ankara were reduced significantly. Another bone of contention in German-Turkish ties is Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza."

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has pleaded not guilty to corruption charges stemming from alleged bribes taken from Turkish diplomats and businesspeople. The indictment, unsealed on Thursday, said Adams received campaign funding and luxury travel perks – including rooms at opulent hotels and meals at high-end restaurants – in exchange for pressuring city officials to allow Turkey’s new 36-storey consulate to open despite safety concerns. The indictment alleged Adams hid campaign contributions from Turkish sources by funnelling them through US citizens. Adams also repeatedly accepted free flights from a Turkish airline, worth tens of thousands of dollars, while staying at luxury hotels at far below market rate. Meanwhile, Adams, at the behest of a Turkish diplomat, pressured city safety inspectors to allow Turkey’s new consulate to open in time for a September 2021 visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the indictment said."

The two presidents also headed the first meeting of the Egyptian-Turkish Strategic Cooperation Council on Wednesday. Some observers say there was discussion of Turkey selling drones to Egypt, but nothing official was communicated in this regard, other than an article in the declaration that pledged “expanding contacts in diverse fields, including military, security, and consular affairs”. “I reiterate the joint stand of Egypt and Turkey calling for an immediate ceasefire, rejecting further escalation by Israel in the occupied West Bank,” el-Sisi said. Analyst Erdogan Aykac, who specialises in Turkish politics at the Netherlands’ University of Groningen, believes both Turkey and Egypt feel they are losing their grip on the situation in Gaza, and want to work together to increase their influence. He added that Turkey and Egypt agreed on the necessity to maintain the unity of Somalia, in reference to Somaliland’s secessionist aims. Turkey has an important base in Somalia, while Egypt announced a deal last week to send arms to Somalia to counter Ethiopia’s influence in the Horn of Africa. From the Turkish side, the rapprochement stemmed from a general shift in foreign policy from 2020-21 onwards. For Egypt, rapprochement came after reconciliation with Turkey’s ally Qatar in early 2021, its suffering economy possibly, making it more open to opportunity. In Egypt, Turkey was seen as one of its main enemies as a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood, which was being designated a terrorist organisation. Many Egyptian Islamist opposition members found refuge in Turkey, from where they operated critical television channels, which often magnified calls for protests in Egypt against el-Sisi. In return, Egyptian media cheered the coup attempt in Turkey in 2016 and deplored its failure. One was Turkey’s intention to drill for natural gas in waters near Cyprus in 2019. In Libya’s conflict, Egypt and Turkey supported opposite sides. Tensions were at their peak in early 2020 when Turkey-backed troops in Libya advanced eastwards from the capital, Tripoli."

Reporting from Ankara, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said that 17 agreements, mostly focusing on trade deals, were signed. Serdar said the meeting marked a new era in relations between Turkey and Egypt, whose leaders have been at odds on various conflicts and political issues for years.

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says efforts to mend ties with Turkey had so far brought no tangible results. Turkey severed ties with Syria in 2011 after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, in which Ankara supported rebels seeking to oust al-Assad. The Syrian president also made clear that while he wants Turkish troops to withdraw from Syria, that was not a condition for talks. “It’s not correct what was announced by some Turkish officials recently, that Syria said if there is no withdrawal, it will not meet with the Turks,” al-Assad said. In July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has been a fervent supporter of the anti-Assad Syrian opposition, said he would extend an invitation to al-Assad “any time” for possible talks to restore relations. Al-Assad said later that month that he was open to meeting Erdogan but it depended on the encounter’s “content”, noting Turkey’s presence in Syria was a key sticking point. A Turkish newspaper earlier reported Erdogan and al-Assad could meet in August, but a Turkish diplomat denied the report. Since the civil war began, Turkey has been a lifeline for the Syrian opposition, providing a base for military and political figures. The country has also been involved militarily in areas along its border with northern Syrian because Ankara considers the presence of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its affiliates, who are present in this region, its primary security threat, which has to be dealt with. The PKK has conducted a war against the Turkish state since 1984 and is considered a “terrorist” organisation in Turkey, the United States and the European Union. In July, Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, told Al Jazeera that the Turkish government had a foreign policy of “normalisation”, part of Erdogan’s “vision of peace”. The Syrian opposition’s relations with the regime are based on their own free decision, their own free choice,” Fidan said before pointing out that opposition fighters had fought alongside Turkish troops to protect Turkey’s security. But within Turkey, the continued rise of anti-Syrian sentiment remains, putting the Turkish government in a difficult position."

Originally government-run establishments, these bathhouses fell out of fashion in Istanbul during the 19th and 20th centuries. Frederic Lacroix’s Guide Du Voyageur a Constantinople Et Dans Ses Environs claims that there were approximately 300 in Istanbul during the 1830s. Ergin Iren, the owner of the Kilic Ali Pasa, explained how the rise of private bathrooms contributed to this decline: “On a very basic level, the introduction of private bathrooms in Istanbul meant that fewer people actually had a reason to visit the bathhouse. Leyla Kayhan, a Turkish historian and fellow at Harvard University, touched on this decline further. The Republican reforms under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic, also brought about a shift in the early 20th century. By the late 20th century, many of the traditional bathhouses in Istanbul had fallen into disarray. “Turkey was going through a period of industrialisation and a lot of new money had come in. “In Turkish society, this meant reviving the aspects of traditional culture that made the region unique.” “International hotels were choosing aspects of Turkish culture that would appeal to their visitors,” Kayhan explained. A slew of historic hammams have also reopened over the last 12 years in Istanbul. De Coster’s cultural programme also invites artists to produce work for the space, including an abstract marble structure from Turkish artist Elif Uras; site-specific sculptural massage units by Athens-based artist Theodore Psychoyos; a soundtrack titled Rhythms of Water, composed by Turkish musician, Mercan Dede; and a bespoke clothing collection for visitors and staff made by renowned fashion designer Hussein Chalayan. “The popularity of our hammam, and the amount of creatives that are eager to respond to the space, shows that bathhouses are still relevant today and are now assuming a new role in Istanbul,” De Coster told me."

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long been a vocal defender of the Palestinian cause, condemning Israel for its actions towards Palestinians, and once notably berating the late former Israeli President Shimon Peres on stage at the World Economic Forum. His vocal support for Palestine reflects how important the Palestinian cause is to many Turkish citizens. The incident fractured Turkey-Israeli relations for years until 2016, when the countries agreed to a pathway to normalising relations. In recent weeks, however, Turkey has become increasingly adamant in its stance. Sinem Adar, an expert on Turkey and a research associate with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), said that Turkey took this step in large part because Erdogan and his base, who tend to be religious Muslims, are passionate about supporting Palestinians. Adar noted that for years Turkey has tried to brand itself as a regional power, but said that Erdogan is not involved in the current ceasefire negotiations, has little leverage over Israel and is “not seen as a credible partner” by Western countries who support Israel militarily and diplomatically. “This move is consistent with the harsh and critical rhetoric that the government has adopted against Israel and it would have been criticised domestically if it did not take this step,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and the director of a Turkey-based think tank Edam. Across Turkey’s political spectrum, Turks are furious with Israel’s devastating war on Gaza. Since then, relations between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated, analysts told Al Jazeera. Turkey has responded by organising pro-Palestinian marches and cutting $7bn worth of trade with Israel. As a member of the North Atlantic Trade Alliance (NATO), a military alliance of 30 countries, Turkey has also blocked cooperation between the alliance and Israel. Now, Turkey is also joining South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ.

Turkey has submitted a formal bid to join South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a move that adds to the international pressure on the Israeli government to end its atrocities in Gaza. A Turkish delegation, including Ankara’s ambassador to The Hague, Selcuk Unal, officially filed the request on Wednesday, the country’s news agency Anadolu reported. Turkey’s “decision to intervene reflects the importance our country attaches to resolving the Palestinian issue within the framework of law and justice”, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. Turkey has now become the seventh country formally seeking to join the case at the United Nations top court after Colombia, Nicaragua, Spain, Libya, Palestine and Mexico. Reporting from Istanbul, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said the Turkish request will boost the case against Israel. In a statement on Telegram, Palestinian resistance group Hamas welcomed Turkey’s decision, calling the the move a confirmation of the Turkish people’s support for the Palestinian cause. The Turkish intervention in the genocide case comes amid an intensifying war of words between Israel and Turkey over Israeli atrocities in Gaza. In July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested that Turkey might “enter” the conflict to help Palestinians, drawing outrage from Israeli officials – particularly the country’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Last week, Katz slammed Erdogan and accused him of turning Turkey into a “dictatorship”. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier this week that Katz has been spreading “lies” about Turkey and its president. “For some time now, the person in question cannot be taken seriously,” it said in a statement, adding that Ankara “will continue to support the Palestinians in the strongest possible way”."

Erdogan says Turkey could intervene in Gaza war A war of words has broken out between Israel and Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened his country could intervene militarily in Israel’s war on Gaza. Turkish and Israeli officials unleashed barbs at one another on Sunday and Monday after Erdogan said in a speech on Sunday that “there is no reason” that Turkey could not act, noting military interventions made in the past in other countries. Shortly after Erdogan’s speech, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said in a post on X that the Turkish president was “following in the footsteps” of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein by threatening to attack Israel. In retaliation, Turkey – not for the first time – compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler. “Just as genocidal Hitler ended, so will genocidal Netanyahu,” said the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Erdogan, who has consistently issued strong rhetoric during Israel’s 10-month war in Gaza, made the suggestion that Turkey could intervene militarily in a speech to his ruling Justice and Development (AK) Party on Sunday. Turkey, which backs the Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, in 2020 sent soldiers to the fractured North African country to support its United Nations-backed administration. In the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, over which Ankara ally Azerbaijan has fought for decades against Armenia, Turkey has denied engaging in any direct military operations. In a post on X on Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan boasted that Erdogan “has become the voice of humanity’s conscience”. Turkey restricted some exports to Israel in April – six months into the war on Gaza – and said it halted trade with Israel altogether in early May. Israel said it would scrap the country’s free trade agreement with Turkey in retaliation, with Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich signalling the move is reversible when Erdogan is replaced by a leader who is “sane and not a hater of Israel”."

Plumes of smoke rise into the night sky as shops burn and mobs unfurl Turkish flags in the central province of Kayseri, chanting that they want refugees out. The video is just one of many that emerged in early July, purporting to show anti-Syrian street violence in Turkish cities. The period saw unrest and tension, fuelled by growing anti-Syrian sentiment in parts of Turkey as well as fears among Syrians opposed to the government of President Bashar al-Assad – both in Turkey and Syria – that is edging closer to normalising relations with the Turkish government. Anti-Syrian riots broke out in Kayseri on June 30 after accusations that a Syrian man had sexually abused a seven-year-old Syrian girl in the Turkish city. The rioters set Syrian-owned shops on fire and flipped cars as they demanded the expulsion of Syrians from Turkey. Turkish authorities arrested 470 people due to the violence and later arrested a 14-year-old who had allegedly released the personal data, including passport details and places of residence, of more than 3.5 million Syrians in Turkey. A day later, in the northern Syrian city of Afrin – controlled by Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces – people protested in solidarity with their compatriots in Turkey. “These protests were initially peaceful and headed towards the governor’s residence, but they lost their peacefulness after the demonstrators took down the Turkish flag [flying there],” Firas Abu Jawad*, a 33-year-old resident of Afrin in northern Syria, told Al Jazeera. Clashes followed and seven protesters were killed “during exchanges of fire with people guarding Turkish positions” in Afrin and another town, Jarablus, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. What may worry Syrians more than the violence is diplomatic moves that make a rapprochement between the Turkish and Syrian governments seem likely. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been a fervent supporter of the anti-Assad Syrian opposition, severing ties with the government in 2011 and backing the protest movement seeking to topple al-Assad."

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey is ready to build a naval base in Cyprus, half a century after its forces invaded the now-divided island. “If necessary, we can construct a base and naval structures in the north” of Cyprus, Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency quoted the leader as saying on Sunday. Erdogan said he flew back to Turkey after visiting Northern Cyprus on Saturday to mark 50 years since Turkey’s invasion. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart following violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and the dispatch of a United Nations peacekeeping force. In 1974, Turkey captured more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Cyprus has since been split by ethnicity, with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living on either side of a UN-patrolled border. In 1983, Turkey installed what it calls the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus – a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey. On Saturday, Erdogan attended a military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkey launched its offensive. A divided Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004 as Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected a UN plan to end their differences with Turkish Cypriots. He also hailed the “precious” presence during Saturday’s visit of the leader of Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), Ozgur Ozel, saying it demonstrated the “unity” of Turkey’s population with regards to Cyprus."

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in northern Cyprus to mark 50 years since the invasion by Turkish forces, has said he sees no point in continuing United Nations-led negotiations on the Mediterranean island’s future. It is of no benefit to anyone to say let’s continue negotiations where we left off in Switzerland years ago,” Erdogan said in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) on Saturday. Northern Cyprus is a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey, and its Turkish Cypriot leadership wants international recognition. Erdogan attended a military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkey launched its offensive. Cyprus has since been split by ethnicity, with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living on either side of a UN-patrolled border. “Turkey is ready to negotiate, discuss, achieve lasting peace, solution in Cyprus,” Erdogan said, adding that both sides “should sit at the table as equals.” “Whatever Mr Erdogan and his representatives in the occupied areas do or say, Turkey, 50 years later, continues to be responsible for the violation of human rights of the entire Cypriot people and for the violation of international law,” Christodoulides said after a memorial service in the southern part of Nicosia in Europe’s last divided capital. In May, Erdogan had told Mitsotakis that there were “no unsolvable problems”, including Cyprus, between their countries as the two leaders met in Turkey’s capital, Ankara. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force.

The “Grey Wolves salute” – the two middle fingers and thumb held together with the index and little finger raised to form a wolf’s head – is associated with an ultranationalist Turkish movement that Germany’s government considers racist and anti-Semitic. “During the Turkish fans’ march, the ‘Grey Wolves salute‘ was made en masse. Demiral’s suspension permeated into a diplomatic row between Turkey and Germany. Turkey summoned the German ambassador to Ankara in response to German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser condemning Demiral’s actions by saying, “The symbol of Turkish right-wing extremists has no place in our stadiums.” Berlin did the same to Turkey’s ambassador the day after. Even Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan got involved, defending Demiral by saying the defender merely expressed his “excitement” after scoring the game winning goal against Austria.

Turkey will soon end its latest ground military operation in northern Iraq, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said. Speaking to military academy graduates on Saturday, Erdogan hailed Operation Claw-Lock, which Ankara launched in April 2022, as a success. The Turkish leader did not give a timeline for the end of the operation and it was not immediately clear what it would mean for the situation on the ground in northern Iraq and Syria, where Ankara has increased air raids in recent months. Turkish forces have been sporadically fighting the northern-Iraq-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) for decades. The PKK, which Ankara, the US and EU consider a “terrorist” group, first took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. Turkey began launching large-scale ground operations in northern Iraq against the PKK in the mid-1990s. More than 40,000 people have been killed during the decades of fighting, with Turkish shelling in July of 2022 killing eight tourists, including a child, at a resort in the Kurdish Zakho district in northern Iraq. In Syria, Turkish forces have targeted the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG), which it regards as a wing of the PKK, as well as the Kurdish-led, US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces. In recent years, Ankara has repeatedly sought to build a buffer or “secure” area along its border with its southern neighbours, launching an operation in 2019 to take control of border areas of northern Syria following the abrupt withdrawal of US troops there. Speaking to Politico earlier this month, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said that Ankara is “fully determined to create a 30-40 km [19 – 25-mile] deep security corridor along our Iraqi and Syrian borders and to completely clear the region of terrorists”. Speaking on Saturday, Erdogan promised that Turkish forces will “complete the missing points of the security belt along our southern border with Syria”, the AFP news agency reported."

Turkey, among the most entertaining teams to watch in Germany, dominated their round of 16 tie against Austria, but in the end, only edged the victory 2-1. Turkey’s calibre came under doubt when they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Portugal in the group stage, but they made a surprising run to the last eight by knocking out in-form Austria, who were themselves emerging as dark horses.

Anti-Syrian riots in Turkey: Violent protests spread to several cities Turkey’s government is urging for calm after violence against Syrian refugees broke out in the central Melikgazi region and spread to other areas. Riots erupted after Turkish authorities arrested a Syrian man for allegedly sexually abusing a seven-year-old Syrian girl in the central city of Kayseri. Turkish residents, infuriated by online reports of the crime, flipped over cars in Kayseri and set Syrian-run shops alight on Sunday night, demanding that Syrians be kicked out of the country. The riots “damaged houses, workplaces, and vehicles belonging to Syrian nationals”, said Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, who accused those responsible of acting “illegally in an attitude that does not suit our human values”. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the violence, which he blamed opposition parties for stoking. More than 3.5 million Syrians live in Turkey, the highest number in the region, who were initially welcomed as refugees when the civil war erupted in Syria in 2011. Most Syrians live under “temporary protection” status and many subsequently became Turkish citizens. But anti-refugee sentiment has been rising in Turkey, particularly against Syrians, for several years because of a deep economic crisis that has seen soaring inflation. Reporting from Istanbul, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said, “This is not the first time that xenophobic protests targeting Syrians has happened in the last three years,” as Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) began to lose popularity amid the dire state of the economy and rising nationalistic sentiment. Umit Ozdag, the leader of Turkey’s anti-migration Victory Party, blamed the violence on the government’s allegedly “privileged” treatment of Syrian refugees. Anti-Syrian riots broke out in Turkey in 2021, after a Turkish teenager was stabbed to death in a fight with a group of young Syrians in the capital, Ankara. The recent violence sparked retaliatory riots in opposition-held areas of northwestern Syria, across the border, including those controlled by Turkish-backed forces."

On the inside of his left arm was the invocation, “be patient”, in Turkish. On the outside of his left hand, the Turkish word for “hope”. Although he found it challenging to find stable work in Turkey, Buyuksu, a Turkish citizen of Kurdish descent, was always looking forward. Soon after, the Mugla police station in eastern Turkey called, asking Buyuksu’s relatives to identify his body. The Turkish coastguard had found him barely alive in an inflatable life raft, adrift about three miles southwest of the Turkish city of Bodrum. Buyuksu died before they made it to Turkish shores. Lawyers in Greece and Turkey and the Bodrum Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office allege that Buyuksu was illegally pushed back from Kos. The Turkish coastguard reported that Buyuksu was declared dead at about 5:20 in the morning. The Palestinians who were on the life raft with Buyuksu later told Turkish authorities that upon their arrival on Kos, they were gathered up by people they identified as “Greek soldiers” and held. They said they heard someone screaming in Turkish in an adjacent room. The sounds of the Turkish citizen suffering and screaming were coming to the room we were in. Additionally as far as I could understand from the sounds, the [Turkish citizen] was being tortured by electrocution,” one said. The Spanish newspaper El Pais, which reported on the incident in December, said Buyuksu’s legal team fears that neither Greece nor Turkey, countries that have long had political disputes, want the case to go further as they are enjoying a moment of good relations. An autopsy conducted by the Forensic Medicine Institute of the Turkish Ministry of Justice, and reviewed by Al Jazeera, concluded that Buyuksu died as a “result of extensive intra-soft tissue bleeding along with multiple rib fractures due to general body trauma”. In November, legal organisations in Turkey and Greece – the Progressive Lawyers’ Association and the Legal Centre Lesvos – released a statement demanding information from Greece about the status of an investigation."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitotakis that there were “no unsolvable problems” between their countries as the leaders met in Ankara. Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over issues including maritime boundaries, energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, flights over the Aegean Sea, and the division of Cyprus. Mitsotakis reiterated Greece’s support for Turkey’s EU accession “despite great difficulties … on the condition it integrates to the European acquis.” The Turkish president said at the joint news conference that more than 1,000 members of the Palestinian group were being treated in hospitals across Turkey. Ties between Ankara and Athens have long been fraught, with the two countries arriving at the brink of war five times in as many decades. Cyprus has been divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities after inter-communal clashes in 1964 and a Turkish invasion of the island 10 years later, following a Greek-inspired coup. The following year, Turkey proclaimed its Blue Homeland policy, claiming sovereign commercial rights to exploit undersea wealth under 462,000sq km (178,400sq miles) of the east Mediterranean, much of which Greece also claimed under international maritime law. In 2019, Turkey agreed to exploit a swath of the east Mediterranean with Libya, further encroaching on what Greece saw as its own maritime jurisdiction. Shortly after, Greece unofficially warned Turkey that it would sink any Turkish survey ship attempting to search for undersea oil and gas in what it considered its jurisdiction. Turkey called Greece’s bluff the following January, allowing its ship Oruc Reis to conduct surveys for a week southeast of Rhodes. Turkey’s navy did the same. And Turkey has a standing threat of war against Greece, should attempt to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean to 12 nautical miles, which Greece says is consistent with international law. The turning point in the escalation was provided by two powerful earthquakes that levelled Turkish cities in February 2023, killing tens of thousands."

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 210 people were arrested on Wednesday. Tall metal barriers were put up around the square – a traditional focal point of protests in Istanbul, where authorities have banned rallies since 2013, when it was the focus of demonstrations against Erdogan’s government. On X, Yerlikaya said that “210 people were detained in Istanbul after failure to heed our warnings and attempting to walk to the Taksim Square and attack our police officers on May 1 Labour and Solidarity Day.” We have legal grounds,” Arzu Cerkezoglu, secretary general of the Confederation of Revolutionary Trade Unions of Turkey (DISK), told AFP. In 2023, Turkey’s top constitutional court ruled that the closure of Taksim Square for protests was a violation of citizens’ rights. Main roads across Istanbul were closed to traffic while public transport including ferries and subway trains was halted because of the security clampdown. Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) and unions had pressed the government to open the square for labour rallies, but Erdogan warned on Tuesday against any provocation. CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, accompanied by Istanbul’s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and labour unions, gathered in the Sarachane neighbourhood."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has met Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in Baghdad for talks on security, economic and energy cooperation. The Turkish president said that cooperation on security and the fight against “terrorism” was one of the most important agenda items during his meetings in Iraq. The PKK, which has fought a decades-long rebellion against the Turkish state and is considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara and its Western allies, has a presence in northern Iraq. Since 2019, Turkey has conducted a series of cross-border operations in northern Iraq against the PKK dubbed “Claw”. Al-Sudani said Turkey and Iraq discussed security cooperation and agreed to deal with the challenge of non-state armed actors that could cooperate with “terrorist” groups. During Erdogan’s visit, the Turkish president and Iraqi premier also witnessed the signing of a preliminary agreement by related ministers of the countries to cooperate on a $17bn Development Road project. Erdogan also said in the press conference that Ankara eyes widening mutual trade – and cooperation in energy, health and tourism – with Iraq. “I believe that my visit and agreements just signed will constitute a new turning point in Turkey-Iraq relations,” Erdogan said in the press conference. The Turkish leader earlier met with Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid in Baghdad. He told Rashid that Turkey “had expectations of Iraq regarding the fight against the terrorist organisation PKK, and that Iraq must be rid of all forms of terrorism”, according to his office. The Turkish president reiterated his call for all relevant parties to refrain from escalating tensions in the Middle East. Bilateral trade between Turkey and Iraq was worth $19.9bn in 2023, down from $24.2bn in 2022, according to official Turkish data. In the first three months of 2024, Turkish exports to Iraq rose by 24.5 percent, while imports fell by 46.2 percent."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has urged Palestinians to unite amid Israel’s war in Gaza, following hours-long talks with Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul, according to his office. Ankara has repeatedly slammed Israel’s incursion into Gaza amid its failed attempts to stop the conflict, which has roiled the Middle East since October 7 last year. The strongest response to Israel and the path to victory lie in unity and integrity,” Erdogan said on Saturday after the talks at the Dolmabahce Palace, according to a Turkish presidency statement. Hamas has had an office in Turkey since 2011, when Turkey helped secure the agreement for the group to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said keeping the crisis in Gaza on the international agenda was a top priority for Turkey. “That is why the Turkish side will continue its diplomatic efforts to keep the matter alive in the eyes of the international community.” Separately on Saturday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan held talks with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, with both men emphasising the need to deliver more humanitarian aid to devastated Gaza, where the threat of famine looms. Turkey is one of Gaza’s main humanitarian aid partners, sending 45,000 tonnes of supplies and medicine to the region."

In the 2019 local elections, Erdogan’s AK Party lost the mayoral race in four of Turkey’s largest cities, including the biggest city, Istanbul – where Erdogan made his name as mayor in the 1990s. Two days later, Turkish press outlets reported that Erdogan had told his party’s executives that the “results demonstrate not only a defeat in the election but also the loss of the party’s soul”. The party has always had its opponents, particularly among the hardline secularists once regarded as the establishment in Turkey. The causes are multi-faceted and touch on the issues facing Turkish voters in general and in particular the AK Party’s traditional voter base in Istanbul and Turkey’s Anatolian heartland. The most obvious issue is the economy, a problem that the Turkish government has faced for a number of years, and that remains the biggest millstone around its neck, leading to widespread frustration, discontent, and grievances. Increased income inequality, runaway inflation, a rapid depreciation of the national currency, soaring costs, and a decline in the standard of living for pensioners are just some of the economic problems the Turkish people are living through, leading to widespread frustration, discontent, and grievances. The Turkish Statistical Institute reports that in October 2022, inflation shot up to 85.5 percent, the highest level in 25 years. Residential property prices in Turkey increased 75.52 percent in December 2023 compared to the same month in the previous year, the highest year-on-year figure in the world. The Turkish lira’s sharp decline in value has impacted businesses and employees alike, and income inequality has also increased. Forecasts indicate that nearly 10 percent of Turkey’s population will earn less than $6.85 a day in 2024, below the poverty line for upper-middle-income countries like Turkey, as defined by the World Bank. CHP politicians, on the other hand, are growing ever more popular, particularly the now-re-elected mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, and the mayor of Ankara, Mansur Yavas."

The Turkish Ministry of Trade said on Tuesday it will no longer send to Israel items in 54 categories spanning iron and steel products, jet fuel, construction equipment, machines, cement, granites, chemicals, pesticides and bricks. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz hit back at Turkey’s announcement saying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is “once again sacrificing the economic interests of the people of Turkey for his support of the Hamas murderers in Gaza”. He added Israel would take “measures that will harm the Turkish economy”, including banning some Turkish imports, asking United States-based organisations to stop investing in Turkey, and calling “our friends in the American Congress” to impose sanctions on Turkey. The announcement of the trade curbs came a day after Turkey promised “step by step” reprisals against Israel after it blocked Turkish cargo military planes from dropping aid over Gaza. “We will continue our support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters until the bloodshed in Gaza stops and they live in a free Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the basis of the 1967 borders,” Erdogan said on Tuesday, adding that Turkey has sent 45,000 tons of humanitarian aid to the region. Israel and Turkey pulled back their ambassadors from their respective capitals shortly after the start of the war. The two countries have been in a war of words since, with Erdogan calling Israel a “terror state”, emphasising Turkish support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and condemning Israel’s decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territory during a hearing at the International Court of Justice. But Ankara had not imposed any actual measures against Israel until Tuesday, with trades falling since October 7 but experts increasing each month this year so far, according to data published by the Turkish Exporters Assembly. The Turkish government has faced domestic criticism over its commercial ties to Israel during the war, something that was seen by many as a factor contributing to a major defeat in local elections at the end of March."

Turkey’s election authority has reinstated a pro-Kurdish mayoral election winner in the eastern city of Van after the annulment of his victory provoked clashes. The Supreme Election Board (YSK) announced on Wednesday that it has overturned a decision by the regional election commission in eastern Turkey to remove Abdullah Zeydan, the candidate of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). The reversal is viewed as another boost for the Turkish opposition following Sunday’s local elections, which dealt a blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party (AKP), after their wins last year in the presidential and parliamentary elections. Zeydan had been arrested and jailed in 2016 after criticising the Turkish army’s air campaign against outlawed Kurdish fighters in the Kurdish-majority southeast. The removal provoked violent protests on Tuesday that lasted throughout the night across the province, which lies on Turkey’s eastern border with Iran. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 89 people were detained, for joining unauthorised rallies and chanting slogans in praise of a “separatist terror organisation”, referring to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that has been blacklisted by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. DEM has often been accused by the Turkish authorities of links to the PKK. The movement is the third-largest party in Turkey’s national parliament. Besides the victory in Van, DEM also claimed the mayorships of other large towns in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast, including Diyarbakir, the region’s largest city. Before the election board’s decision to reinstate Zeydan, Istanbul’s re-elected mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, seen as a likely rival to Erdogan, called the events in Van a “total aberration”. “We will be following this meaningless practise of double standards from Van,” Imamoglu, whose party backed the DEM in its battle against the Van ruling, told a crowd of about 500 supporters gathered outside Istanbul’s main court after he was officially given a mandate to serve five more years."

Istanbul’s CHP mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, held the city, defeating AK Party candidate and former Environment and Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum with just more than 51 percent of the vote. Erdogan, 70, was born and raised in Istanbul and served as its mayor in the 1990s, so the defeat was seen as a personal blow. Imamoglu, 53, was elected mayor of Istanbul – Turkey’s economic hub and largest city with 16 million people – in 2019, ending 25 years of rule by the AK Party and its conservative predecessors. Imamoglu’s career mirrors Erdogan’s: Both began their political careers in Istanbul in the 1990s and had them obstructed by legal issues. Imamoglu is from the secularist CHP, joining in 2008 and becoming mayor of Istanbul’s Beylikduzu district 10 years ago. He studied business administration at Istanbul University, graduating in 1994, the year Erdogan became mayor, before going into his family’s construction business. In 2022, Imamoglu was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison and banned from politics on charges of insulting Turkey’s Supreme Election Council. The mayor denied insulting electoral council members with the comment, saying he was responding to Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, who called Imamoglu “a fool” and accused him of criticising Turkey. The CHP’s candidates won in 35 of Turkey’s 81 provinces, including Antalya, Denizli and Izmir. Besides Imamoglu declaring victory in Istanbul, CHP Mayor Mansur Yavas also held on to the capital, Ankara, defeating his challenger, veteran politician Turgut Altinok, with just more than 60 percent of the vote. The CHP had hoped to have a chance against Erdogan after domestic economic turmoil and the fallout from the devastating February 2023 earthquakes in southern Turkey."

Turkey’s main opposition party has claimed victory in Istanbul and Ankara in local elections, inflicting the biggest defeat on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in more than two decades. With more than 95 percent of ballot boxes opened in Istanbul on Sunday, Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) said he had defeated the governing AK Party candidate by more than one million votes. “Tonight, 16 million Istanbul citizens sent a message to both our rivals and the president.” In the capital, Ankara, CHP’s Mayor Mansur Yavas claimed victory over his rival, hailing the result as a “clear message to those who rule this country”. The CHP was also ahead in Izmir, Turkey’s third city. In total, CHP prevailed in 36 of Turkey’s 81 provinces, state-run Anadolu Agency reported, making inroads into many AK Party strongholds. Opposition supporters gathered in Istanbul to celebrate the results, with tens of thousands of people lighting torches and waving Turkish flags. In a speech delivered from the balcony of the presidential palace, Erdogan, who has governed Turkey since 2002, acknowledged that his party had “lost altitude” across the country and said he would self-reflect and rectify any mistakes. In previous local elections in 2019, Imamoglu won Istanbul’s mayoral race, dealing Erdogan and the AK Party their biggest electoral blow until that point. Some 61 million people were eligible to vote for mayors across Turkey’s 81 provinces as well as provincial council members and other local officials on Sunday. The nationwide local elections were seen by analysts and civilians as a gauge of both Erdogan’s support and the opposition’s durability amid skyrocketing inflation and the crumbling of the Turkish currency against the dollar. Sinan Ulgen, director of the Istanbul-based Edam think tank, told The Associated Press news agency that “the surprising outcome” was the result of voters wanting to punish the governing party over the state of the economy and described the elections as a “watershed for Imamoglu”."

Istanbul, Turkey – Across much of the world, local elections generate little interest beyond the town hall but in Turkey, voting for officials ranging from metropolitan mayors to neighbourhood representatives grips the nation for weeks ahead of polling day. Despite having turned out for presidential and parliamentary polls only 10 months ago, Turkish television and newspapers have been full of news, opinion and debate on the March 31 local vote. Across the country, voters will elect more than 23,000 officials but most attention will be on the mayors picked to run Turkey’s 30 largest cities. This is especially true in Istanbul, the country’s most populous city and its economic powerhouse, where an opposition victory in 2019 was seen as a setback in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s largely flawless electoral record. Victory for the Republican People’s Party (CHP) in Istanbul five years ago ended the city’s 25 years of rule by Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and its conservative predecessors. The loss of Istanbul also struck a personal note for Erdogan, who was born and raised in the city and served as its mayor in the 1990s. Ejder Batur, deputy chairman of the AK Party’s Istanbul branch, cited Erdogan’s spell as mayor as one of the factors behind his success on the national stage and a sign of why local polls have such significance. “Istanbul has a symbolic significance in every election and all the big cities now have CHP mayors apart from Bursa, the fourth-biggest city,” said CHP Deputy Chairman Ilhan Uzgel. Istanbul’s 2019 result was mirrored in the capital Ankara and Antalya, leaving the CHP in control of four of the five biggest cities, accounting for one-third of Turkey’s population. Retaking Istanbul would also give the AK Party the opportunity to sideline its CHP Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is seen as a potential presidential challenger in the future. This year’s election will see some 35 political parties taking part across Turkey. The level of participation is such that voters in Istanbul will be given a ballot paper nearly a metre (3 feet) wide to accommodate 49 mayoral candidates, including 27 independents."

Voters in Turkey have gone to the polls in local elections in a crucial test for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he seeks to win back control of key urban areas he lost to the opposition five years ago. The vote on Sunday is also a barometer of Erdogan’s popularity and will decide who gets to control the economic hub of Istanbul and the capital Ankara, both of which he lost in 2019. The 70-year-old Turkish leader has set his sights on wresting back Istanbul, a city of 16 million people, where he was born and raised, and where he began his political career as mayor in 1994. “Winning major cities is more of a deal for the opposition, but also it means access to foreign funds, having transnational links with both economic actors and political actors,” Evren Balta, professor of political science at Turkey’s Ozyegin University, told Al Jazeera. For the opposition – divided and demoralised after a defeat in last year’s presidential and parliamentary elections – keeping Istanbul and Ankara would be a tremendous boost and help remobilise supporters. Voting stations closed at 4pm (13:00 GMT) in eastern Turkey and 5pm (14:00 GMT) elsewhere. During Sunday’s local elections, clashes between two groups in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast left one dead and 12 people wounded, a local official told AFP. Turnout is traditionally high in Turkey, but this time the vote comes against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. Opinion polls have pointed to a close race between Istanbul’s incumbent mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition, pro-secular Republican People’s Party, or CHP, and the AK Party’s candidate Murat Kurum, a former urbanisation and environment minister. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said whoever wins the polls will have “far-reaching implications” on Turkey’s politics. In Ankara, incumbent Mayor Mansur Yavas – also seen as a potential future challenger to Erdogan – is expected to retain his post, according to opinion polls."

Istanbul, Turkey – As nationwide local elections approach on March 31, there are concerns in Turkey about the growing threat of disinformation and fake media created through artificial intelligence. Earlier this year, a video spread across social media purportedly showing Istanbul’s opposition mayor praising President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party). Ekrem Imamoglu, of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), is seen in the video commending the “great steps” taken in public transport projects when the AK Party controlled Istanbul. Political scandals over “leaked” recordings are nothing new in Turkey. Fake videos and images present a “huge threat” in the upcoming election, Emre Ilkan Saklica, director of fact-checking project Teyit (“verification” or “collaboration” in Turkish), said. The Workers’ Party of Turkey announced on Sunday that it was withdrawing the mayoral candidacy of former footballer Gokhan Zan in Hatay, one of the southern provinces hit by last year’s earthquakes. Last week, video footage circulated of CHP officials in Istanbul counting bundles of cash, hinting at corruption within the opposition. “However, beyond these technologies, images or videos that are called cheap fakes can be produced in just a few minutes and can become widespread much more easily in Turkey.” Addressing this month’s election, Ejder Batur, deputy chairman of the AK Party in Istanbul, accused the CHP of creating “perceptions … with advertisements and disinformation” to mislead the public about its record in Istanbul over the last five years. When the Turkish parliament passed a law in October 2022 to fight disinformation, critics said the bill, which criminalised “disseminating false information” with a prison sentence of up to three years, would stifle access to information and deepen online censorship. “We are faced with a type of disinformation that aims to influence the election results,” Oguzhan Bilgin, a TRT board member and director of the Istanbul-based Diplomacy Foundation, said."

At least 22 people, including several children, have died after the rubber dinghy they were travelling on capsized off the Turkish island of Gokceada in the Aegean Sea. “The Turkish coastguard found the bodies of 22 people including seven children,” the local governor’s office said in a statement on Friday. Governor Ilhami Aktas told the state-run Anadolu Agency that the Turkish coastguard rescued two people from the sea off the town of Eceabat in Canakkale province, while two others were able to reach the shore by themselves, Turkish officials said the boat began sinking overnight and that many ambulances were standing by at the port of Kabatepe near Gokceada. The Turkish coastguard also said that it had rescued or intercepted several hundred people, including children, attempting to cross to Greece since the start of the week. Many migrants try to reach the Greek islands from Turkey’s western coasts to head to prosperous European Union countries, with many dying in the perilous sea crossing. The issue of irregular migration is a thorn in relations between NATO members Turkey and Greece, who are already embroiled in longstanding disputes from exploratory drilling rights in the eastern Mediterranean to the divided island of Cyprus. Greece has also frequently accused Turkey of waving migrants through their joint border and at sea. Ankara in turn has accused Athens of illegal pushbacks of migrant boats. In 2016, Turkey struck a deal with the EU to curb the influx of people seeking refuge in the EU in return for financial assistance and other incentives. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Athens in December, Turkey and Greece agreed to open a new page in their troubled relations and address their problems including irregular migration through dialogue. The issue of irregular migration is likely to figure highly in talks when Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visits Ankara in May."

Speaking after their meeting on Friday, Erdogan, who has balanced relations with Moscow and Kyiv throughout the two-year war, spoke of “opportunities that Turkey can provide with its stance”. Erdogan, who reiterated Turkey’s support for Ukraine’s “territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence”, said he and Zelenskyy had discussed port security, safety in the Black Sea, prisoner exchanges and food security. Turkey’s strategic location on the Black Sea and its control of the Bosphorus Strait gives it a unique military, political and economic role in the conflict. Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Turkey hosted failed ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow. “Both sides have now reached the limit of what they can achieve through war,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said this month.

Turkish police have detained seven people suspected of selling information to the Israeli spy agency Mossad. The suspects were taken into custody on Tuesday during simultaneous raids in Istanbul, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X. The detentions are the latest in a wave of such arrests in Turkey. The detainees are suspected of collecting data on individuals and companies in Turkey and selling it to the Israeli intelligence agency, Yerlikaya said. The raids were a joint operation with Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT). A video released by the Minister of the Interior showed police raiding homes in Istanbul and apparently seizing guns, drugs and electronic devices. Last month, seven other people were arrested on similar grounds, while in early January, 34 people were detained by Turkish police on suspicion of spying for Israel. The suspects arrested in January have been accused of planning to carry out activities including reconnaissance and “pursuing, assaulting and kidnapping” foreign nationals living in Turkey. Following years of tension, Turkey and Israel normalised ties in 2022 and reappointed ambassadors. However, the resumed quickly deteriorated with the start of the Israel-Hamas war, with Ankara one of the strongest critics of Tel Aviv’s military campaign in Gaza. In December, the head of Israel’s Shin Bet security agency said that his organisation was prepared to target the Hamas group anywhere, including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan quickly warned of “serious consequences” should Israel target anyone on Turkish soil."

Istanbul, Turkey – Earthquake fever has gripped Istanbul since last year’s disaster in southern Turkey, as residents in Europe’s most populous city fear they could face similar devastation. The city lies near the North Anatolia faultline, a geological danger that has seen Istanbul hit by at least 34 strong earthquakes over the last 2,000 years. Smaller tremors can be felt by people in Istanbul every year – an ominous reminder of the danger that lurks beneath their streets. For many, witnessing the stark devastation caused to swaths of Turkey last February added to their anxiety over the inevitable but unpredictable arrival of “the big one”. Istanbul’s official population is 16 million, but estimates based on household water consumption by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality put the figure at 20 million. Those built before 1999 – the year a powerful earthquake in the eastern Marmara Sea rocked Istanbul, killing 18,000 people – are considered particularly at risk. Istanbul is Turkey’s finance and trade powerhouse – last year it accounted for more than half of Turkish exports – and such a blow would ravage the country’s economy. Okan Tuysuz, a professor at Istanbul Technical University’s Eurasian Earth Sciences Institute, said the North Anatolia fault could be expected to generate a quake of magnitude 7.5. “Serious damage may occur in Istanbul, especially on the coasts facing the Marmara Sea,” he said. Murat Kurum, the mayoral candidate for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party), is aiming to recapture Istanbul from Imamoglu, the Republican People’s Party politician who took it in 2019. “We see that this time the focus of the campaign is earthquake and urban transformation,” Ozer Oz, a board member of Istanbul’s Chamber of Civil Engineers, said. “However, the earthquake danger for Istanbul has not just emerged. Kurum served as minister for environment, urbanisation and climate change between 2018 and 2023, a role central to preparing Turkey’s cities for disaster. Critics highlighted a building amnesty during his period in office when more than three million building registration documents were issued across Turkey to those who paid a fine rather than bringing their buildings up to code."

The Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects said on Wednesday that the government should close the Copler mine in the eastern town of Ilic “immediately”. Eighty percent of Anagold is owned by SSR Mining, which is based in Denver in the United States, and Turkey-based Lidya Madencilik and Calik Holding. Rescuers have been searching through a cyanide-laced field in the area, located in Turkey’s mountainous Erzincan province, to find the workers. Environmentalists fear that cyanide and sulphuric acid used in the gold extraction process could spread into the Euphrates River, which runs from Turkey to neighbouring Syria and Iraq. A Turkish court then fined the company 16.5 million Turkish lire ($537,000 at the current exchange rate). Turkey has a poor mine safety record. The country’s worst mining disaster took place in 2014 at a coal mine in Soma, western Turkey, where 301 people were killed."

Gaziantep, Turkey – A few hours after the first massive earthquake that struck southern Turkey and northern Syria last year, Ahmad Nached decided to marry his partner, Anna Rudnichenko. Rudnichenko decided to move to Turkey from her native Zaporizhia in 2021, seeking independence after graduating from university. “I always had this affinity for Turkey because, when I was little, I lived here for a few years,” she told Al Jazeera. Since then, Nached has been working with Syrian humanitarian organisations in Turkey while cultivating his passion for electronic music at Room41, a collective of Syrian and Turkish DJs trying to brighten up Gaziantep’s nights. “So I went to the console, quite angry, complaining to the DJ and asking him why the party was already over,” she laughs from the couch, sipping a hot cup of Turkish tea. As a Syrian in Turkey, Nached says he experiences a lot of racism. Turkey hosts more than three million Syrian refugees, and there have been tensions between them and the local population since 2012, highlighted by the earthquake fallout and national elections characterised by a ferocious campaign against Syrians. On the other hand, since early 2022, Turkey has also welcomed thousands of Ukrainian refugees, who feel a lot more welcome and integrated. In February 2023, Nached and Rudnichenko spent a couple of days in a shelter in the city before being evacuated to a hotel in Ankara through Nached’s workplace. After five months, they decided to give up and stay in Turkey. Last September, during a trip to Istanbul’s Princes Islands, Nached proposed to Rudnichenko, and the two got married in Gaziantep on Christmas Day."

But none were struck harder than those already on society’s bottom rung – Turkey’s Romani, Abdal and Domari communities. Although not recognised as minorities in Turkey, these groups, which migrated from northern India over the last millennium, are estimated to number up to five million people who live in poverty, social exclusion and discrimination. In the aftermath of the magnitude 7.8 earthquake – and the second, nearly as strong, that followed hours later – that hit in the early hours of February 6, killing more than 50,000 in Turkey and 8,000 in north Syria, Romani, Abdal and Domari families found themselves struggling more than others to access aid and support. While “Roma” is used as a blanket term for those who left India at various times, there are three distinct groups in southern Turkey – the Romani, linked to those who passed into Europe; the Domari, who left India at a different time and did not reach Europe; and the Abdal, who solely identify as Turkish but still face discrimination as “Roma”. Rising prejudice facing Turkey’s Romani, Abdal and Domari since the earthquakes has been fuelled by far-right hate speech, according to Jonathan Lee, advocacy and communications director at the European Roma Rights Centre. In 2010, Turkey’s then-prime minister and current president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, hosted a meeting of Romani, Abdal and Domari in a bid to address their problems. When the earthquakes struck, leading to a declaration of a state of emergency across 11 Turkish provinces, the Romani, Abdal and Domari found their problems worsening. Beyond the disaster area, minority groups also faced discrimination, according to Romani Godi and the Civil Dreams Association, which jointly sought to house a group of 20 Abdals in Ankara. “They made them leave after just one night, claiming they were not earthquake survivors and they just came to Ankara for work and accused them of stealing,” Baysak said."

The United States has approved the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey after the Turkish parliament this week ratified Sweden’s NATO membership. The US Department of State notified Congress of the $23bn agreement to sell the warplanes to NATO ally Turkey on Friday night, along with a companion $8.6bn sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets to Greece, also an ally in the Western military bloc. The department’s notification came hours after Turkey deposited its “instrument of ratification” for Sweden’s accession to NATO with Washington, which is the repository for alliance documents and after several key members of Congress lifted their objections. The sale to Turkey includes 40 Lockheed Martin F-16s and equipment to modernise 79 of its existing F-16 fleet. Turkey has long sought to upgrade its F-16 fleet and requested the jets in October 2021, but its delay in approving Sweden’s NATO bid became an obstacle to winning congressional approval. Ankara had made its ratification of Sweden’s membership contingent on the approval of the sale of the new planes. President Joe Biden’s administration had supported the sale, but several lawmakers had expressed objections due to Turkey’s human rights record. “My approval of Turkey’s request to purchase F-16 aircraft has been contingent on Turkish approval of Sweden’s NATO membership. “I look forward to beginning this new chapter in our relationship with Turkey, expanding the NATO alliance, and working with our global allies in standing up to ongoing Russian aggression against its peaceful neighbours,” he said. Ankara had delayed its approval of Sweden’s NATO membership for more than a year, ostensibly because it believed Stockholm did not take Turkey’s national security concerns seriously enough, including its fight against Kurdish fighters and other groups it considers to be security threats. US and NATO officials have said they expect Hungary to act quickly, especially after Turkey’s decision."

Turkey’s parliament has approved Sweden’s NATO membership bid after more than four hours of debates. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days, ending the 20-month-long delay that has frustrated some of Ankara’s Western allies. “Positive that the Grand General Assembly of Turkiye has voted in favour of Sweden’s NATO accession,” he wrote on social media platform X. Turkey’s ratification leaves Hungary as the last holdout in an accession process that Sweden and its neighbour Finland began in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago. Ankara has profited from maintaining – and even expanding – trade with Russia while at the same time supplying Ukraine with drones and other essential arms. Turkish media reported that Putin could make his first wartime visit to Turkey next month. Erdogan’s objections to Sweden’s bid initially focused on Stockholm’s perceived acceptance of Kurdish groups that Ankara views as “terrorists”. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax Turkey’s arms export policies. The Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee approved the Swedish bid last month after Erdogan forwarded it to parliament in October. However, Erdogan has since demanded that the US follow through on its pledge to deliver a batch of F-16 fighter jets for Turkey’s ageing air force. US officials argued that Turkey’s request could win the required congressional approval if Sweden’s NATO accession goes through – a position reaffirmed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a visit to Istanbul this month. “We have not parsed words about how ready we are for Sweden to formally join the alliance,” said US Department of State deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel after news emerged that Turkey was finally ready to ratify the Swedish candidacy."

Gocer, 38, was riding his motorcycle on an Istanbul highway on November 30 when a car with diplomatic registration plates smashed into him from behind, severely injuring him. Mohamud, who was driving the car, left Turkey before an arrest warrant and travel ban could be issued. Officials said he returned to Turkey on January 12 to give a statement, at which point the arrest warrant and travel ban were revoked. But on Tuesday, Istanbul’s 33rd Criminal Court of First Instance settled on a fine of 27,300 Turkish lira ($906). In the clip, Gocer is seen on his motorcycle on the busy highway, which is the main road to Ataturk Airport. “What Turkey and the world witnessed through camera footage is a murder disguised as an accident.

Delivery workers’ deaths in Turkey are also often treated as accidents rather than “occupational homicides”, which could force vehicle drivers to be more careful, Ceki said. Gocer’s case has drawn widespread attention in Turkey and Somalia. Dozens of protesters gathered in front of the Somali embassy in Ankara after the rider’s death, asking for Mohamud – who had left Turkey at the time – to be transferred back to the country. There were also protests in Istanbul. Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters a few days after Gocer died that “if there is a fault, if there is a crime, it will be pursued. Like Turkey, conditions are poor for courier riders in several countries. Turkey is one of Somalia’s strongest allies and aid donors. As officials investigate how Mohamud was able to leave the country after the accident, President Sheikh Mohamud told The Associated Press news agency in December that his son had not “fled” Turkey and that he had advised him to present himself to the court. “Turkey is a brotherly country,” the president said."

On Tuesday, the Istanbul court fined him 27,300 Turkish lira ($900), state media reported. Mohamud was charged with “causing death by negligence” after a diplomatic car he was driving hit courier Yunus Emre Gocer in Istanbul on November 30. An arrest warrant was issued for Mohamud after Gocer died six days later, but the president’s son had already left Turkey on December 2. Mohamud reportedly returned to Turkey last week to testify. “The life of a motorcycle courier cannot be worth 27,000 Turkish lira when the other side is 75 percent at fault,” said Mesut Ceki of the Courier Rights Association. Prison sentences are occasionally converted to fines in Turkey’s judicial system. Gocer’s death had threatened to sour friendly relations between Turkey and Somalia. The Somali president said last month that his son, who is a doctor, did not flee Turkey and that he had told him to present himself to court. “Turkey is a brotherly country,” the president had said. Turkey has sought to increase its footprint in Somalia in the past decade and is the Horn of Africa nation’s leading economic partner, particularly in the areas of construction, education and health."

Turkey’s military has carried out air raids against Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq and Syria. The overnight air raids destroyed 23 targets, the Turkish Ministry of National Defence said on Tuesday. The operation extends a recent escalation in violence across Turkey’s southern border, as regional tension continues to rise amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. The upswing in the conflict began on Friday when nine Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters in northern Iraq. Ankara responded with air attacks and military operations in the area, as well as in northern Syria. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. Turkish forces regularly strike PKK fighters based in the mountains of northern Iraq. Syrian state media and other sources said on Monday that Turkey had carried out a wave of air attacks on electricity and oil infrastructure in Syria’s Kurdish-held northeast, putting several power stations out of service. Turkey has carried out a series of military incursions and bombing campaigns in Syria against the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG), which it regards as a wing of the PKK."

A Turkish court has released pending trial an Israeli footballer who was detained after displaying a message apparently marking 100 days since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7. Turkish authorities called the Antalyaspor club’s player for questioning after the incident and charged him with “openly inciting the public to hatred and hostility”, according to Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) added: “We condemn the completely unacceptable behaviour of footballer Sagiv Jehezkel during the match between Antalyaspor and Trabzonspor played today (…) and find Antalyaspor’s decision to exclude the player from its team appropriate.” “Shame on you, Turkish government,” former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennet wrote on X. Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause, has repeatedly described Israel as a “terrorist state” and Hamas as a “group of liberators”. In a separate incident, Istanbul’s top-flight side Basaksehir said it was launching a disciplinary investigation into another Israeli player, Eden Karzev, for reposting a social media message about the hostages, reading: “Bring Them Home Now”."

Turkey has bombed multiple locations allegedly linked to Kurdish groups in Syria and northern Iraq in retaliation for the deaths of nine Turkish soldiers in Iraq, the defence ministry said. The raids on Saturday came one day after an attack on a Turkish military base in Iraq resulted in the soldiers’ deaths. Turkey frequently carries out attacks against locations in Syria and Iraq that it suspects to be associated with the PKK. The Kurdish separatist group, which is banned in Turkey, is considered a “terror” organisation by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. The statement said that “many” armed fighters were “neutralised” in the attacks, a term Turkey uses to refer to killed or captured fighters. Turkey launched Operation Claw-Lock in northern Iraq in April 2022, during which it established several bases in the Duhok governorate. Iraq has repeatedly protested against the presence of Turkish troops and called for their withdrawal. “We will fight to the end against the PKK terrorist organisation within and outside our borders,” Turkey’s foreign minister Hakan Fidan posted on X. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was to hold a security meeting in Istanbul later on Saturday, said his communications director Fahrettin Altun. Three weeks ago, PKK-affiliated fighters tried to break into a Turkish base in northern Iraq, according to Turkish officials, killing six soldiers. The following day, six more Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes. Turkey retaliated by launching attacks against sites that officials said were associated with the PKK in Iraq and Syria. More than 40,000 people have been killed since the start of the conflict between the PKK – which maintains bases in northern Iraq – and the Turkish state since 1984. Turkey and the US, however, disagree on the status of the Syrian Kurdish groups."

On Thursday, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said the deal establishes a Mine Countermeasures Task Group among the three NATO allies to deal with the mines as he met in Istanbul with his Romanian counterpart, Angel Tilvar, and Bulgarian Deputy Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov. Three minehunting ships from each country and one command-control ship will be assigned to the initiative, a Turkish Ministry of National Defence official said. Last week, Turkey said it would not allow two minehunter vessels donated to Ukraine by Britain to transit its waters en route to the Black Sea because it would violate the 1936 Montreux Convention, an international pact concerning wartime passage of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles strait. At the start of the Ukraine war, Turkey enacted the convention to block the passage of Russian or Ukrainian ships through the two straits and also told non-Black Sea states not to send warships."

In his meeting with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Blinken “emphasised the need to prevent the conflict from spreading, secure the release of hostages, expand humanitarian assistance and reduce civilian casualties”, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Saturday. “In Turkey, we focused extensively on what Turkey can do, using its influence, using its ties, to help prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading,” Blinken said, speaking to journalists in Crete on Saturday evening. “We also talked about the role that Turkey can play, both in the day after for Gaza, in terms of the challenging questions of Palestinian-led governance, security, rebuilding, as well as the work that it can do to try to produce more lasting durable peace and security in the region.” Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, had skipped a meeting with Blinken when the US diplomat visited Ankara in November over Washington’s staunch backing of Israel’s assault on Gaza. On Saturday, Blinken also met Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and discussions focused on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said. The US’s strained relationship with Turkey precedes the current war, with the two nations also feuding over foreign policy issues ranging from NATO to Iraq. Ankara is frustrated by the delay in approval from the US Congress for a $20bn deal for 40 F-16 fighter jets. Washington is waiting for Turkey to ratify Sweden’s bid to join NATO. On Saturday, Blinken and Fidan addressed Ankara’s process to ratify Sweden’s NATO membership, according to officials from both sides. US officials are confident Ankara will soon approve Sweden’s accession after it won the Turkish parliament’s backing last month, a senior State Department official travelling with Blinken told the Reuters news agency."

Turkey has reportedly detained 33 people suspected of spying on behalf of Israel. Ankara has previously warned that it will not allow Israel to strike at Hamas inside Turkey’s borders. The suspects were detained in raids in Istanbul and seven other provinces for allegedly planning to carry out activities that included “reconnaissance” and “pursuing, assaulting and kidnapping” foreign nationals living in Turkey, the agency reported. The report came weeks after the head of Israel’s domestic security agency, Shin Bet, said in an audio recording that his organisation is prepared to destroy Hamas “in every place,” including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Israel of “serious consequences” if it pressed ahead with its threat to attack Hamas officials on Turkish soil. Following years of tension, Turkey and Israel moved towards normalising ties in 2022 as they resumed diplomatic ties. But that detente quickly deteriorated during the Israel-Hamas war, with Ankara becoming one of the strongest critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Israel initially withdrew its diplomats from Turkey over security concerns and later announced it was recalling its diplomats for political reasons, citing “increasingly harsh statements” from Turkish officials. Turkey also pulled its ambassador from Israel. But the Turkish leader has since intensified his criticism of Israel, describing its actions in Gaza as verging on “genocide”. The Turkish leader, whose government has hosted several Hamas officials in the past, has also said that the Palestinian group – considered a “terrorist organisation” by Israel, the United States and the European Union – is fighting for the liberation of its lands and people. The arrests have come amid a spate of arrests by Turkish security forces. The detentions were thought to be part of a drive by Turkey’s security forces ahead of New Year festivities. An ISIL attack in Istanbul on January 1, 2017, killed 39 people. Analysts say that President Erdogan is eager to win back control of Istanbul, Ankara and other major economic hubs that his AK Party has lost."

The Turkish Super Cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce scheduled to be played in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh was called off over an apparent disagreement about the players’ jerseys. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) and the two teams – who returned to Istanbul on Saturday after Friday’s postponed match – said the decision was made because of “some problems” in the event’s organisation. Haberturk television and other Turkish media said players from both Istanbul football teams wanted to wear T-shirts that featured an image of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered founder of the modern Turkish republic, during a prematch warm-up, but were not authorised to do so by Saudi organisers. Turkish media also reported that Saudi authorities did not allow banners featuring political slogans and Ataturk T-shirts to be displayed ahead of the match, including those with Ataturk’s “peace at home, peace in the world” slogan. “We had been looking forward to holding the match on time in accordance with the international football rules and regulations which require presenting the sport without any slogans outside its scope, especially since this was discussed with the Turkish [Football] Federation in the framework of the preparatory meetings for the match,” the statement said. The organisers also said that it had been agreed that Turkey’s national anthem would be played in the stadium and its national flag displayed in the stands. Many fans had wanted the annual match to be played in Turkey, which this year commemorated its 100-year anniversary as a republic. The cancellation of Friday’s final, which some football fans on X have called “peak Middle Eastern football drama”, has added to what has been a controversy-filled month for Turkish football. The president of club Ankaragucu, Faruk Koca, was arrested this month for punching a referee in the face at the end of his team’s Super Lig home match against Rizespor, which also led to the suspension of the Turkish league. On Saturday, photographs and video footage showed hundreds of Galatasaray and Fenerbahce fans cheering, waving Turkish flags and carrying pictures of Ataturk at the Istanbul and Sabiha Gokcen airports."

Turkey has announced it has arrested 189 people suspected of having ties to the ISIL (ISIS) armed group as the government continues to detain people across the country. Turkey’s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said on social media platform X on Saturday that the suspects were arrested as part of “Operation Heroes-38”, which took place simultaneously in 37 provinces. The detentions come amid a drive by Turkey’s security forces ahead of New Year festivities, although some also view it as part of a political push ahead of local elections due in March. Analysts say that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is keen to win back control of Istanbul, Ankara and other major economic hubs that his AK Party has lost. Yerlikaya had said on Friday that the detentions had thwarted planned attacks on churches and synagogues in Istanbul. According to Turkish state news agency Anadolu, the suspects included three alleged senior ISIL fighters. It added that plans also included an attack on the Iraqi embassy in Ankara. Turkey continues to be targeted and has been hit by a string of deadly bombings. An attack in Istanbul on January 1, 2017, killed 39 people in a nightclub during New Year celebrations. The detentions come a week after police rounded up 304 suspected ISIL fighters in simultaneous raids across Turkey, in a similar security operation before the New Year. Turkish authorities have also ramped up operations against Kurdish fighters in recent weeks, after they detonated a bomb near government buildings in Ankara on October 1."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, likening Israel’s assault on Gaza to Nazi Germany’s killing of Jews. In remarks at an awards ceremony in capital Ankara on Wednesday, Erdogan asked what difference there was between Netanyahu and Hitler. Netanyahu later responded by pointing to Turkey’s own history of alleged rights abuses. Erdogan’s remarks have come as Turkey ratchets up criticism of Israel, reversing a trend of growing ties between the two nations before Israel’s assault on Gaza took a devastating humanitarian toll that has sparked outrage across the region. The Turkish leader has previously levelled harsh criticism at Netanyahu and Israel, calling Israel a “terror state” with “unlimited” Western support in November. The Israeli prime minister later hit back at Erdogan, criticising Turkey for its own record of alleged rights abuses at home and in its conflict with Kurdish armed groups. Despite such firm criticism, Turkey has maintained commercial ties with Israel throughout its nearly three-month assault on Gaza in a “genocidal” campaign that has killed more than 21,000 people, wounded 55,000 others and displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population."

Turkey has hit 71 sites allegedly linked to Kurdish groups in Syria and northern Iraq during air raids launched this week in retaliation for the deaths of 12 Turkish soldiers in Iraq, the defence minister has said. Ankara uses that term to refer to killed or captured fighters of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). Twelve Turkish soldiers were killed during fighting with the PKK in northern Iraq, the Ministry of Defence said on Saturday, prompting Turkey to conduct numerous air raids and operations in the region. Turkish officials said that on Friday, fighters affiliated with PKK attempted to infiltrate a Turkish base in northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Six Turkish soldiers were killed in the ensuing firefight. The following day, six more Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes with Kurdish fighters. Turkey insists it takes care to avoid civilian casualties and harm to cultural heritage. The PKK, which maintains bases in northern Iraq, has led a decades-long rebellion against the Turkish state and is considered a terror organisation by Ankara, the European Union and the United States. Turkey and the US, however, disagree on the status of the Syrian Kurdish groups, which have been allied with Washington in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIL) group in Syria. The PKK is viewed as a national security threat by Turkey, which controls areas in northern Syria and has military bases in Iraq’s north in a bid to push alleged PKK and affiliated groups from its border."

The decision, taken on Tuesday, is a key step towards enlarging the military alliance after 19 months of delays in which Ankara demanded security-related concessions from Stockholm. If he signs it into law, he would conclude a process that has taken nearly two years and frustrated some of Ankara’s allies in the West. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also hailed the approval by the Turkish parliamentary commission. “I welcome the vote by the Turkish parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee to ratify Sweden’s NATO membership,” Stoltenberg said, urging Turkey and fellow holdout Hungary to complete their ratifications “as soon as possible”. Erdogan raised objections in May last year to both Swedish and Finnish requests to join the alliance over what he said was their protection of people whom Turkey accuses of being “terrorists” and over their defence of trade embargoes. Turkey ratified Finland’s bid in April but kept Sweden waiting until it took more steps to crack down on local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey, the European Union and the United States list as a terrorist group. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax arms-export policies affecting Turkey. While NATO member Hungary has also not ratified Sweden’s membership, Turkey is seen as the main roadblock to adding the Scandinavian nation to the military alliance and bolstering its defences in the Baltic Sea region. Erdogan had also linked Turkey’s ratification of Sweden’s membership with the US approval of sales of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey."

In recent weeks, Turkish authorities have also carried out operations against the outlawed Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or PKK, which Ankara considers a terrorist organisation.

But Muizzu, who became president after a raucous and divisive anti-India campaign, chose to make his first official trip to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, showcasing an intent to diversify and reorient his country’s foreign policy. His choice of Turkey suggests a more nuanced message to India, according to analysts. While India views China as a national security threat, its formal ties with Turkey are more steady — though increased scarred by tensions. Turkey has criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to abrogate Indian-administered Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status and has highlighted human rights violations in the region at the United Nations. Against this backdrop, Muizzu’s visit to Turkey “would not be an easy track” for India to accept, said Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat who served as ambassador to Libya and Malta. “It appears to be a deliberate stance in the context of India-Turkey tensions,” he said. A Turkish official, who requested anonymity, suggested that Ankara had no interest in stoking tensions between India and the Maldives, but was looking after its own interests. Under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has looked to expand its geopolitical clout — playing a vital role in negotiations over the Russia-Ukraine war, among other issues — and South Asia has been no exception. In June, Turkey hosted Bangladesh’s president. Last month, Turkish Airlines resumed direct flights to Sri Lanka after a decade. In January 2022, then-Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu visited the Maldives and Sri Lanka. During Muizzu’s visit to Ankara in November, the two countries signed a free trade agreement and committed to strengthening defence ties: Turkey has one of the world’s most advanced defence industries. Turkey and the Maldives are increasingly also aligned on key geopolitical challenges — they have both strongly criticised Israel’s war on Gaza, while India has been more ambivalent, only recently joining calls for a ceasefire. Yet, Muizzu’s Turkey visit is ultimately less about Ankara and more about distancing Male from New Delhi, said analysts."

NATO enlargement was discussed during Erdogan’s visit, according to Hungarian President Katalin Novak, who also met the Turkish leader. Orban presented Erdogan with the gift of a Nonius horse – though the Turkish leader fell off a horse in 2003.

Turkish football’s “night of shame” has caused the country’s most popular sport to spiral into a crisis and has raised questions about on-pitch violence towards match officials. Here’s a look at the events that unfolded since the violent incident in Ankara: The Turkish Super Lig match between MKA Ankaragucu and Caykur Rizespor ended in a 1-1 draw on Monday after the visitors equalised in the last minute of added time. Koca appeared to be incensed at Meler for sending off one of his players and then awarding a stoppage-time goal that allowed Rizespor to leave Ankara with a draw. Meler was released from hospital in Ankara on Wednesday after undergoing observation and receiving a phone call from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. MKE Ankaragucu’s Koca is a politician, former parliamentarian, aspiring Ankara mayor and member of Erdogan’s AK Party. “I apologise to the Turkish refereeing community, the sports public and our nation,” he added.

The Somali president’s son allegedly killed a motorcycle courier in a traffic accident in Istanbul’s Fatih district, according to Turkish media reports, which said he fled the country after the incident. The prosecution issued an international arrest warrant for the president’s son on Friday, days after he left the country, the reports said, adding that the suspect’s exit from Turkey was on record and he could not be reached by the authorities. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu criticised the authorities for allowing the suspect to leave the country. “We said we would follow the legal process, but the suspect left Turkey with his hands free. Turkey has steadily increased its footprint in Somalia in the past decade and is the Horn of Africa nation’s leading economic partner, notably in the construction, education and health sectors. Ankara has been a significant source of aid to Somalia following a famine in 2011. Turkish engineers have helped to build infrastructure in Somalia, businesses have invested in the country and Turkish officers have trained Somali soldiers as part of efforts to build up the country’s army."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is in Greece in an effort to mend strained relations between the neighbouring NATO allies and open what he called a “new era” in relations after years of hostility. Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over issues including where their continental shelves start and end, energy resources, overflights of the Aegean Sea, and ethnically split Cyprus. Earlier, Erdogan told Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou: “I believe that the Turkey-Greece strategic cooperation meeting will lead to a new era” in relations, adding that “we need to be optimistic, and this optimism will be fruitful in the future”. “If we consider what is happening around us, it is necessary probably more than ever that Greece and Turkey work jointly to reinforce prosperity, safeguard peace and stability and respect for international law,” Sakellaropoulou replied. Greece and the European Union also hope to update their 2016 migration deal with Ankara. Greek Migration Minister Dimitris Kairidis this week said the two countries’ coastguards had been cooperating smoothly on migration in past months and suggested the possibility of an agreement with Turkey to station a Turkish officer on the Greek island of Lesbos, and a Greek officer at the western Turkish port of Izmir. Issues that have brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war five times in as many decades are expected to stay off the agenda."

Athens, Greece – Issues that have brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war five times in as many decades will be off the agenda during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Athens on Thursday. Greece and Turkey have been discussing 31 potential areas of cooperation since 2021. Refugee flows from Turkey to Greece fell by 40 percent in October relative to September, and by a further 30 percent in November, the Greek migration ministry said. Cyprus has been divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities after inter-communal clashes in 1964 and a Turkish invasion of the island 10 years later, following a Greek-inspired coup. The following year, Turkey proclaimed its Blue Homeland policy, claiming sovereign commercial rights to exploit undersea wealth under 462,000sq km (178,400sq miles) of the east Mediterranean, much of which Greece also claimed under international maritime law. In 2019 Turkey agreed to exploit a swathe of the east Mediterranean with Libya, further encroaching on what Greece saw as its own maritime jurisdiction. Shortly after, Greece unofficially warned Turkey that it would sink any Turkish survey ship attempting to search for undersea oil and gas in what it considered its jurisdiction. Turkey called Greece’s bluff the following January, allowing its ship Oruc Reis to conduct surveys for a week southeast of Rhodes. Turkey’s navy did the same. And Turkey has a standing threat of war against Greece if it should attempt to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean to 12 nautical miles, which Greece says is consistent with international law. The turning point in the recent escalation was provided by two powerful earthquakes that levelled Turkish cities in February, killing tens of thousands. Turkish violations of Greek airspace in the Aegean stopped, allaying a constant Greek complaint. After elections in both countries in May and June, freshly mandated foreign ministers met in Ankara in September, paving the way for Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Erdogan to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly a fortnight later. Greece’s Deputy Foreign Minister Kostas Frangogiannis and his Turkish counterpart met in October."

And while there is no clear timeframe for approving the purchase request for the F-16s, Ankara has linked the issue to Sweden’s bid. Last month, the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs commission delayed a vote on Sweden’s membership bid in a setback to the Nordic country’s hopes of joining the Western alliance after 18 months of waiting. Turkey has demanded that Sweden take more steps to rein in local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara, the European Union and the United States. NATO allies recently voiced disappointment over the prolonged process in Ankara.

The ship sank in the Black Sea amid a burst of stormy weather, killing at least one sailor and leaving the remaining 11 crew members missing, Turkey’s interior minister said on Monday. The weather front that wrecked the vessel killed at least nine people, including the sailor, over the weekend in Turkey. The Kafkametler cargo ship went down with 12 crew members on board after hitting a seawall 120km (75 miles) east of Istanbul, Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. Turkish rescuers, initially held back by the poor weather, on Monday scanned the waters by helicopter in search of the missing sailors. The Turkish-flagged ship was transporting ferrosilicon – an alloy used in steelmaking – from the Russian port of Temryuk to Aliaga in Turkey. The storms that broke out in northwestern Turkey caused havoc over the weekend, destroying another cargo ship, forcing the evacuation of a prison, and killing at least nine people.

Erdogan would then sign it into law to conclude the process, the length of which has frustrated Ankara’s allies and tested its Western ties.

Turkey has demanded that Sweden take more steps to rein in local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara, the European Union and the United States. In response, Stockholm introduced a new “anti-terrorism” bill that makes membership of a “terrorist” organisation illegal, while also lifting arms export restrictions on Turkey. NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax arms-export policies towards Turkey during the process, while the White House said it would move ahead with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey in consultation with the US Congress. While there is no clear timeframe on approving the purchase request for the F-16s, Ankara has linked the issue to Sweden’s bid. Some analysts say Turkey’s parliament could fully ratify the bid by the time of a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on November 28-29. The delay comes as Ankara has been at odds with its Western allies over the conflict in Gaza, while its tough diplomacy over the war in Ukraine has also irked some allies. Ankara maintains good relations with Moscow and Kyiv, opposing Russia’s invasion but also the Western sanctions on Russia. While NATO member Hungary has also not ratified Sweden’s membership, Turkey is seen as the main roadblock to Sweden’s accession."

He called for Israeli leaders to be tried for war crimes at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and repeated his view – and Turkey’s position – that Hamas is not a “terrorist organisation” but a political party that won the last Palestinian legislative elections held in 2006. Ankara would take steps to ensure Israeli settlers in occupied Palestinian territories are recognised as “terrorists”, he said. Netanyahu, speaking at an event in Israel, said he will not be “morally lectured” by the Turkish leader, saying Erdogan supports “the terrorist state Hamas”. The Turkish leader had taken a more nuanced line immediately after Hamas launched attacks on southern Israel on October 7. Turkey this month recalled its ambassador to Israel and broke off official contacts with Netanyahu, suspending recent attempts by the two countries to repair their rocky relations. Israel has also said it is “re-evaluating” relations with Ankara after calling back its diplomatic staff from Turkey and other countries in the region as a security precaution. Erdogan made his comments two days before a planned meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has been forced to defend his decision to receive the Turkish leader."

Istanbul, Turkey – The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly direct in their criticism of Israel. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office. The following year, relations with Israel were again strained over what Turkey called Tel Aviv’s “unconciliatory” policy, which included Israel’s decision to claim Jerusalem as its capital."

Members of a group of relatives of victims of enforced disappearances in Turkey held a vigil in central Istanbul without police intervention for the first time since 2018. Known as the “Saturday Mothers” (“Cumartesi Anneleri” in Turkish), the group has met every Saturday since May 1995 in the heart of Istanbul, holding peaceful sit-ins to demand justice and remember relatives who went missing after a military coup in 1980 and during a state of emergency in the 1990s, especially in the predominantly Kurdish southeast. In 2018, police violently cracked down on their demonstration following an announcement by local authorities that it would be banned because calls for the rally had been allegedly made on social media accounts linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), listed as a terrorist group by Ankara and its Western allies. Ten protesters held their vigil on Saturday without any police interference, at Istanbul’s Galatasaray Square. The resumption of the vigil comes after Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, the former governor of Istanbul, on Wednesday said the government had “good intentions” and a peaceful solution would be found over the issue, responding to questions by opposition lawmakers during a parliamentary session."

The 47-year-old Atalay was allowed to run from jail in May’s general election and was elected to parliament as a member of the leftist Workers’ Party of Turkey (TIP). Turkey’s bar association and the main opposition party have denounced the appeals court’s ruling as an “attempted coup”, and hundreds of members demonstrated, many of them lawyers in legal robes, chanting “justice” on the streets of the capital on Friday. They marched more than 10km (6 miles) from the Ankara courthouse to the Ahlatlibel district, where the Constitutional Court and the Court of Cassation are located side by side. “Our citizens need to understand that this struggle is not just a struggle of lawyers, it is a struggle for the constitution,” said the head of the Ankara Bar Association, Mustafa Koroglu. In comments made later at a ceremony in Ankara, Erdogan said the dispute between the two top courts showed the need for a new constitution, reflecting his longstanding position that parliament should take up the matter next year. The latest crisis showed that Erdogan wants “more control over what happens in Turkey, including a judicial system that does what he wants, such as prosecuting and imprisoning his critics and opponents”, according to analyst Gareth Jenkins. It coincided with the European Commission’s release of an annual report on Turkey’s long-stalled European Union membership bid, in which it underlined “serious backsliding” on democratic standards, the rule of law and judicial independence. The commission also said Turkey did not comply with the principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms in its “counterterrorism” operations."

Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has slammed the European Commission’s annual report assessing its long-stalled bid to join the European Union, saying it was unjust and biased. The report, published on Wednesday by the EU’s executive arm, accused Ankara of “serious backsliding” on democratic standards, the rule of law, human rights and judicial independence. “We categorically reject unfounded claims and unjust criticisms, particularly on the political criteria and the Chapter on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The Commission also said Turkey did not comply with the principles of the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in its counterterrorism operations. The Turkish ministry said the allegations were unfair and highlighted “the insincerity of EU’s approach and a clear double-standard”, adding that fundamental rights issues were contentious even among EU member states. The Commission’s report is meant to update Turkey’s progress towards meeting standards for EU membership and could strain ties that are already troubled over immigration and, more recently, the war between Israel and the Hamas armed group in Gaza. Since Israel started bombarding the Gaza Strip on October 7, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of “behaving like a war criminal” and blamed the West for being the “main culprit behind the massacre unfolding”. Turkey began talks to join the EU in 2005, but that bid has long been frozen due to rights concerns and foreign policy rifts. The EU has grown frustrated by Turkey’s stance on issues such as Syria, Cyprus, and Libya as well as its competing territorial claims with Greece to islands in the Aegean Sea. On September 13, the European Parliament adopted a report by the European Commission stating Turkey’s EU accession process “cannot be resumed” without a “drastic change of course” by Ankara. Erdogan responded that Ankara could “part ways with the EU” if necessary."

Blinken met Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan for two and a half hours on Monday morning in the Turkish capital Ankara, but was snubbed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “And the Turks know this. Blinken’s trip to Turkey follows on the heels of strained meetings with Arab leaders in Iraq, Palestine, and Jordan over the weekend. “We discussed … efforts to significantly expand the humanitarian assistance to people in need, and efforts to prevent the conflict expanding to other parts of the region and what we can do to set the conditions for a durable, sustainable, lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians,” Blinken later told reporters at the airport before departing Ankara. Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Ankara, suggested that Blinken and Fidan found few points of agreement. “The US side tried to convince Turkish officials to put more pressure on Hamas and make it release the captives,” he said. “But the Turkish position was very clear on this matter. “Turkey also asked for an unconditional ceasefire and said there should be an international mechanism to observe the ceasefire, which Ankara would be the guarantor for,” Serdar continued. He has been using the phrase ‘humanitarian pause’ and the Turkish side has told him that this is not enough.” Turkey, which is a strategic US ally despite numerous foreign policy rifts, has been one of the region’s fiercest critics of Israel since the war broke out, accusing Israel of behaving like a “war criminal” and committing a “massacre”. On Saturday, Ankara recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv, with Erdogan saying he had “written off” dealing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Turkish leader has delivered equally stinging criticism of Western powers that are backing Israel amid the Gaza bloodshed. Turkey’s frustration towards Washington was on clear display during Blinken’s visit. In an apparent snub, Erdogan ditched Blinken to travel across northeastern Turkey, leaving him to convene with his foreign minister. Hours before the Blinken’s arrival, hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside an airbase that hosts US troops in southeastern Turkey."

Athens, Greece – Greece’s migration minister has welcomed the Turkish government’s willingness to reduce migration flows from Asia into Europe, during an interview with Al Jazeera. He was comparing the new Turkish attitude to Ankara’s policy in March 2020, when Turkey unilaterally departed from a four-year-old agreement with the European Union that obliged both sides to hold back undocumented refugees and migrants. Kairidis, whose government took office in July, visited his Turkish counterpart, Ali Yerlikaya, on October 19. “I was presented with a lot of data from the Turkish side,” Kairidis said. Turkish authorities said they had arrested 140,000 undocumented people attempting to cross into Europe since the beginning of the year. And Turkey said it had arrested 5,000 smugglers. “These are all very positive, and we see especially on the land border with Greece and Bulgaria a very determined action on the part of Turkey’s security forces, army police and gendarmerie, to do away with smugglers and flows,” Kairidis said. “Turkey does not want to be an international hub of illegal migration,” said Kairidis, because Turkey was already hosting an estimated 4.7 million refugees, and trafficking “stimulates increased flows into Turkey at a time of great fluidity”. But Kairidis believed Turkey’s about-turn was also due to the fact that “the previous policy did not work”. Arrivals on the Greek islands from the Turkish coast had shot up over the summer. Not everyone agreed that these increases were due to Turkish smugglers stepping up their business or Turkish authorities dropping their vigilance. “We have the oldest Muslim community in Europe,” he said, referring to a 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, which left intact the Muslims of Thrace and the Greek Christians of Istanbul."

The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that Sakir Ozkan Torunlar was being recalled “in view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians and Israel’s refusal of calls for a ceasefire and the continuous and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid.” The move has come as Ankara’s rhetoric has become increasingly critical of Israel, which has killed about 9,500 Palestinians, including 3,900 children, in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed about 1,400 people. Spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lior Haiat, criticised the decision as “another step by the Turkish president that sides with the Hamas terrorist organization,” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Turkey hosts members of Hamas, which it does not consider a “terrorist” organisation like the United States and the European Union. On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was breaking off contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We have written him off,” Turkish media quoted Erdogan as saying. But he added that this does not mean Turkey is cutting its relations with Israel and his intelligence chief is in contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities as well as Hamas. Erdogan also said that when the war is over, Turkey wants “to see Gaza as a peaceful region that is a part of an independent Palestinian state, in line with 1967 borders, with territorial integrity, and with East Jerusalem as its capital”.

Istanbul, Turkey — A “freedom convoy for Palestine” is on its way from Istanbul to a United States military base in southern Turkey in solidarity with the people of Gaza as Israel wages war on the besieged enclave. Cars and vans displaying Palestinian and some Turkish flags departed from Istanbul’s Ataturk Olympic Stadium on Friday morning and headed to the city of Adana, where the Incirlik Air Base is located. The Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH), the Turkish non-profit that organised the event, said hundreds of vehicles were driving towards Turkey’s capital, Ankara, on Friday afternoon with many more protesters expected to join as the convoy stops in cities along the way, covering nearly 1,000km (620 miles). Convoys departing from three other Turkish cities – Kahramanmaras, Kayseri and Van – were also expected on Sunday to reach Adana, where the demonstrators plan to encircle the Incirlik Air Base to protest against US support for Israel and to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The US and Turkish air forces are the primary users of the airbase, which has been used to fly combat missions over Iraq during the first Gulf War and launch air strikes on Afghanistan. A white bus with a banner that read “Freedom convoy for Palestine” stood out among dozens of vehicles that set off from Istanbul, joined by local pro-Palestine groups and some international activists. Turkey has taken a firm position critical of Israel’s actions. On Saturday Turkey recalled its ambassador to Israel for consultations, citing the “unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza” and Israel’s unwillingness to work towards a ceasefire. Ten activists died in an Israeli raid on the Mavi Marmara, which carried mostly Turks, causing a rift in Turkey-Israel relations that the two sides had only recently started to mend. “Anyone who has some humanity should join this convoy,” Mustafa Ozbek, a spokesperson for the IHH, told Al Jazeera as the convoy made its way to Ankara. “We’re driving down the highway right now, and we expect to be joined by more people in Ankara,” he added. People in Turkey have been protesting in large numbers against the war in Gaza since it began."

The low-profile affair shows the far-reaching impacts of the bloody Israel-Hamas war, but also brings up uncomfortable divisions within Turkish society over the state’s secular legacy, elements of which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has sought to challenge. On Sunday, Erdogan laid a customary wreath at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey’s revered founding father. Erdogan was scheduled to travel to Istanbul afterward to watch a procession of military ships on the Bosporus, followed by a drone and fireworks show. However, Turkey cut down on much of the fanfare expected for the once-in-a-century event. Erdogan’s appearance at a pro-Palestine rally in Istanbul the day before also partly eclipsed the centennial. Turkey’s scaled-down centennial celebrations angered some citizens who believe Erdogan is glossing over the occasion to undermine Ataturk’s secular legacy in pursuit of his own political vision — and that of his religious support base. Still, many Turks held their own private celebrations, while opposition-run municipalities organised concerts and parades. Music, including a song that was written to mark the republic’s 10th anniversary, blared from cars adorned with Turkish flags. Turkey’s history is intimately tied to Ataturk, a nationalist leader who prioritised development reforms and separated religion from public life. Even today, Ataturk is deeply venerated throughout Turkey, where his poster is seen on the walls of schools, offices, and homes. But not all Turks are equally inspired by Ataturk’s legacy, including Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party, who look fondly upon Turkey’s Ottoman and Islamic past. And while Erdogan pays homage to Ataturk’s early military accolades, he rarely lauds his republican-era leadership."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called off a planned visit to Israel over its “inhumane” war in Gaza, saying relations between the two states would not improve. Erdogan’s biting remarks extend a deterioration in ties between Turkey and Israel, which have had a rocky, back-and-forth relationship for years. Once tight regional allies, Turkey froze links with Israel in 2010, after Israeli military forces carried out a raid on a Turkish ship heading to Gaza with aid supplies, killing 10 civilians. While the two states restored ties in 2016, Turkey again dismissed Israeli envoys in 2018 over Israel’s deadly crackdown on peaceful Palestinian protesters at Gaza’s fence with Israel. However, as Israeli bombs rain on Gaza for a third week, killing more than 6,500 people and wrecking much of the territory’s infrastructure, the Turkish leader is again pulling few punches. Erdogan, who has led Turkey for two decades, is a vocal advocate of the Palestinian cause. In his Wednesday address to parliament, the Turkish president also praised Hamas as “liberators” who are fighting to “protect their lands and people”. Erdogan is expected to attend a mass pro-Palestinian rally in Istanbul on Saturday organised by the governing Justice and Development Party."

Erdogan told his NATO allies at a summit in July that he would send the legislation to the Turkish parliament when it reconvened on October 1, having previously raised objections over a range of security concerns. Since parliament reopened, however, Turkish officials have repeatedly said Stockholm needed to take more concrete steps to clamp down on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) armed group, which has been designated a “terrorist organisation” by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. “The Protocol on Sweden’s NATO Accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey,” the presidency said on social media platform X on Monday. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he looked forward to a “speedy vote” in the Turkish parliament. Sweden’s bid for membership has been ratified by all members apart from Hungary and Turkey. Turkey also was angered by a series of Quran-burning protests in Sweden. Turkey’s foreign ministry called the events a “despicable attack” and called for “decisive measures to prevent this hate crime” in a statement issued at the time. In July, Sweden’s Supreme Court rejected an extradition request from Turkey for two men accused of membership in the movement of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey blames for a failed coup effort in 2016. Turkey lifted its opposition after US President Joe Biden’s administration signalled it would let Turkey buy 40 new F-16 fighter jets and modernisation kits from the US. Ankara also received assurances from Sweden that it would help revive Turkey’s own quest to join the EU. Under the deal, NATO as an organisation agreed to address Turkey’s concerns about “terrorism”."

As the Ottoman Empire gave way to the increasingly Westernised Turkey of the 18th and 19th centuries, sensibilities moved away from older traditions, such as hammams, causing many – including Cinili Hamam – to fall into disrepair. Now, after a long and ambitious 13-year restoration effort, this lost treasure has been revitalised through the efforts of the Marmara Group and is once more a place of cleansing and relaxation, but also one that reflects much of Turkey’s hidden history. What was originally intended to be just another luxury bathhouse has evolved substantially, embracing Turkey’s rapidly expanding artistic scene as a new arts venue, including an on-site museum furnished with artefacts uncovered during the reconstruction effort. Turkish designer Ezgi Turksoy’s ceramic installation piece, entitled A Floor Talisman, takes the form of a ring of bright white, porcelain seashells arranged on the flagstones. “The circle has a lot of meaning and symbolic value in esoteric cultures and traditions,” explained Turksoy. The museum also provides an insight into the baths’ incredibly sophisticated water and heating systems along with interactive experiences that allow guests to explore a virtual reconstruction of Cinili Hamam, as it was at its height in the 16th century, along with a vast collection of objects associated with Turkish hammam culture."

Istanbul, Turkey – The war on Gaza has seen Turkey step forward as a potential mediator to not only end Israel’s bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, but also bring lasting peace to one of the world’s most intractable conflicts. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led his country’s bid, keen to promote Turkey as a global player and replicate Ankara’s success in mediating between Ukraine and its invader, Russia, to strike a deal for Kyiv to export grain. Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory air raids on Gaza – which have yet to end – came as Ankara and Tel Aviv were fostering warmer ties after more than a decade of hostility. Turkey has relations with Hamas, making it one of the few countries with any influence with the group that has ruled Gaza since 2007. Ankara did not declare Hamas a “terrorist organisation”, leading Tel Aviv to protest that Turkey-based Hamas members have been involved in planning attacks on Israel. “Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas, which is an important asset,” Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, said. “It has been built up over 17 years, when Turkey was the only country to invite Hamas into [its capital]. “In these times of crisis, the communication channels and relations are important,” said Ozhan, a former chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee. Turkish officials – led by Erdogan and his foreign minister, Hakan Fidan – have acted on this advantage, seeing a central role for Ankara in resolving the latest Gaza conflict. Speaking in Beirut on Tuesday, Fidan said “a variety of countries” had asked Turkey for help in releasing their citizens. There is wide public support in Turkey for the Palestinian cause, with pro-Palestine demonstrations drawing thousands of Turks in recent days. At the same time, Turkey had relations with Israel for much of Israel’s history, until things hit a rough patch in 2010. That year, Israel killed nine Turks who were on board a Freedom Flotilla trying to deliver humanitarian aid to a besieged Gaza Strip, with a tenth dying after years in a coma."

The Pentagon says United States warplanes have shot down a Turkish drone, which was deemed a threat to its forces in Syria, in an incident that might raise tensions between the NATO allies. The development came on Thursday as Turkey targeted Kurdish forces in Syria following a suicide bombing in Ankara that was claimed by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). A few hours later, a Turkish drone returned to the ROZ and flew towards American forces despite what a US official said were a dozen calls to Ankara’s military. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Turkish counterpart Yasar Guler on Thursday, urging “de-escalation in northern Syria and the importance of maintaining strict adherence to de-confliction protocols and communication through established military-to-military channels,” Ryder said in a statement. Turkey’s defence ministry confirmed the call, saying the two officials discussed “the latest developments in Syria”. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said the UAV did not belong to the Turkish military, according to a statement. “It is not only the Turkish military that conducts counterterrorism operations in northern Iraq and Syria,” she said. She said that the Turkish intelligence and interior ministry’s gendarmerie also joined operations. On Thursday night, Turkish military air attacks killed 26 fighters and destroyed 30 Kurdish fighter targets in northern Syria, including an oil well, a storage facility and shelters, and “neutralised” many fighters, the Turkish defence ministry said. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said Turkish officials say operations are carried out as part of the country’s right to self-defence. “Turkey has warned other countries to stay away from areas controlled by groups it will continue to target,” he said. On Friday, Turkey’s military conducted another round of air strikes in northern Syria and destroyed 15 other targets where it said PKK-affiliate fighters were believed to be, according to the defence ministry. However, Turkey views the Kurdish People’s Protection Units that dominate the SDF as an offshoot of the PKK, which is considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara and its Western allies."

Turkey’s military conducted air strikes in northern Iraq and staged several raids across the country this week in response to the attack, detaining dozens of suspects with alleged links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), listed as a “terrorist group” by Turkey and its Western allies.

The PKK, listed as a “terrorist group” by Turkey and its Western allies, has been waging attacks since 1984, killing tens of thousands of people. A series of successive Turkish military operations has pushed the group back into neighbouring Iraq. The PKK attack on Sunday coincided with the opening of Turkey’s parliament session, during which lawmakers will be asked to ratify Sweden’s membership in the NATO military alliance. Turkey’s ratification has been held up by its anger over the refusal by the Swedish police to ban marches by the PKK and their supporters in Stockholm. Some analysts believe the PKK may be trying to block the ratification because it would herald an improvement in Turkey’s tense ties with the United States. Turkey is also trying to get the US to drop its support for Kurdish fighters from the YPG group in Syria, a policy shift Ankara may expect in return for its ratification.

The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) is in the spotlight after Turkey blamed it for Sunday’s suicide blast in front of the Ministry of Interior in Ankara. Within hours of the attack, Turkey carried out air raids on northern Iraq, targeting what it said were 20 PKK positions. Ankara has long claimed that the PKK is sheltering across the border in Iraq’s Kurdish province. The PKK has been designated as a “terrorist organisation” by Ankara and its NATO allies, who condemned Sunday’s attack as “terrorism”. On Sunday, a car with two men inside pulled up at the Interior Ministry’s gate in the Kizilay neighbourhood of the Turkish capital. Turkish authorities said the first perpetrator was killed when he detonated the bomb on his person, and the second attacker was shot dead. The attackers are believed to have started their operation in Kayseri, 260km (161 miles) southeast of Ankara where they are suspected of killing a veterinarian and taking his vehicle to avoid arousing suspicion in Ankara, according to local media reports. It said a team affiliated with the Kurdish armed group’s “Brigade of Immortals” was behind the attack, which was “an act of legitimate defence” against the Turkish government, which the statement accused of trampling on the rights of the Kurdish people. Among other things, the Turkish parliament is expected to discuss ratifying Sweden’s accession to NATO soon. NATO member Turkey has demanded that Sweden crack down on “Kurdish separatists” in its territory as a condition for its ratification. So far, Turkish intelligence and security apparatuses have been staging raids across the country. After raiding 28 addresses, they have arrested 20 individuals with links to the suicide bombing, including a few politicians from the pro-Kurdish HDP party, according to Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu reporting from Turkey. In addition, Koseoglu said, Turkish intelligence claims to have “neutralised” the mastermind of a 2007 attack in Daglica that killed 12 Turkish soldiers.

Turkey: PKK claims responsibility for Ankara suicide bombing Turkey says its warplanes have carried out raids on Kurdish targets in northern Iraq following a suicide attack on a government building in capital Ankara. A Turkish interior ministry statement on Sunday said about 20 targets of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) group were “destroyed” in the aerial operation, including caves, shelters and depots. Iraqi President Abdul-Latif Rashid on Monday said in an interview with Saudi Arabian state-owned broadcaster Al-Hadath that his country does not accept the repeated Turkish strikes or the presence of Turkish bases in the Kurdistan region and hopes to come to an agreement with Turkey to solve this problem. It was not clear if the interview was filmed before or after Turkey’s latest strikes. Sunday’s strikes came hours after a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device near an entrance of the interior ministry building in Ankara, injuring two police officers. The PKK is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. According to the state-run Anadolu Agency, the two attackers had seized the vehicle from a veterinarian in the central province of Kayseri, a city 260km (161 miles) southeast of Ankara. The suicide attack occurred hours before the Turkish parliament was set to reopen after its three-month summer recess with an address by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the blast was “the latest attempt” to inflict terror on the Turks. The PKK and ISIL (ISIS) have carried out such attacks in tourist areas and city centres of Turkey in the past. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said security was tightened around the parliament and interior ministry buildings after the attack. There is also a Turkish flag by the gate to express solidarity and the territorial integrity of the country,” she said.

The bomb on Ataturk Boulevard was the first in Ankara since 2016 and comes on the day that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is set to attend the opening session of parliament, located one kilometre (0.6 miles) away. A senior Turkish official told Reuters the attackers had hijacked the vehicle and killed its driver in Kayseri, a city 260km (161 miles) southeast of Ankara, before carrying out the attack. Police also announced they would carry out controlled explosions for “suspicious package incidents” in other parts of Ankara. The incident comes almost a year after six people were killed and 81 wounded in an explosion in a busy pedestrian street in central Istanbul. Turkey blamed Kurdish militants for the explosion. Erdogan was set at 7:30pm to attend the opening of parliament, which in the coming weeks is expected to consider ratifying Sweden’s bid to join NATO after Turkey had raised initial objections and delayed enlargement of the bloc. President of the European Council Charles Michel said he strongly condemned what he called the “terrorist” attack, while EU Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi said it supports Turkey “in its fight against terrorism”."

A suicide bomber has detonated an explosive device in front of the ministry building in the Turkish capital Ankara, wounding two police officers, according to the country’s interior minister. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the “terrorists” will never achieve their aims, a few hours after an attack near the country’s parliament in Ankara. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said the explosion took place at about 9:30am (06:30 GMT). The attack comes as Turkish authorities have been carrying out operations against ISIL (ISIS) members. This is the first attack since October 2015, when an ISIL assault in front of a central station in Ankara killed 109 people. Ahmet Keser, a retired Turkish army colonel and head of Political Science and International Relations at Hasan Kayloncu University, said this was “a very well-organised terrorist incident”. A judicial investigation has been launched into the attack, according to Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc. “These attacks will in no way hinder Turkey’s fight against terrorism. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Turkey’s main opposition leader, condemned the “terrorist attack” and vowed that Turkey would be united in fighting any such assaults from any source."

That is what the Turkish president said on September 18 commenting on the collective West’s dependability and on his frustration with Turkey’s long-stalled attempts to join the European Union. “He’s like a market trader – he smiles and asks about your family, but all he wants is your money and your recommendation to another buyer,” Valentin Aleksashenko, a Kyiv-based IT analyst who regularly holidays in Turkey, told Al Jazeera. He calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dear friend”, recently gave him a red-carpet reception in Istanbul, and has helped negotiate the release of war prisoners and the extension of the “grain deal” to ship Ukrainian wheat via the Black Sea. Erdogan’s reluctance to take sides works for him at home – especially since his voters realise how reluctant most EU member states are to let their nation in, and how Western “double standards” on migration spur anti-Western sentiments among them, said Seda Demiralp of Istanbul’s Isik University. “His voters are convinced that an independent position benefits Turkish interests most. Turkish voters do appreciate closer ties with the West while at the same time realising Turkey is never treated as an equal partner by the West,” she told Al Jazeera. He can neither alienate the West nor Russia,” Gonul Tol, a Turkish-born analyst with the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “From Western and Russian points of view, no matter how frustrated they get with Erdogan, they, too, think they must cooperate with Turkey,” Tol said. “Time has shown that both leaders follow their nations’ interests, but can agree and compromise at the same time,” said Emil Mustafayev, an analyst based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Turkey’s key ally in the former Soviet Union. Russian czars and Ottoman sultans were at war a dozen times, and Czar Nicolas I famously called Turkey “Europe’s sick man” before the Crimean war that pitted Turkey and Western powers against Russia in the 1850s."

A group of pro-government journalists and writers in Turkey have released a video, titled We Are One Nation, in Turkish and Arabic, condemning the recent treatment of refugees and migrants in the country. The journalists, speaking in Turkish and Arabic, said Muslims are one nation and claimed that some people in Turkey are “sowing seeds of racism”, apparently referring to reported violent incidents between Turks and foreigners in the country. “We Turks are a nation that has been known for its hospitality in every period of history and has embraced Muslims. Those who claim to be Turks and practise racism have nothing to do with the values of the Turkish nation,” the journalists added. The video went on to claim that some people in Turkish society are trying to “spread discord among Muslims today as they did 100 years ago”. We are all one people, we are Turks, Kurds, Arabs, Georgians and others. Violence and verbal abuse between Turks and Syrians have been increasing in the country, and nationalist rhetoric is on the rise following the presidential and parliamentary polls in May, which saw nationalist parties increasing their votes. The communal tensions have climbed further as Turkey goes through the worst economic crisis in decades. About 3.3 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey with temporary protection permits, Turkish authorities say. However, various opposition parties in Turkey say their count shows that the number of refugees in Turkey is more than 10 million. She added: “The remaining part can stay with the right integration policy, learning Turkish, active participation in business and education.” The Turkish government recently toughened its policies in large cities against refugees under “temporary protection” status, asking people in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and economic hub, under this status but registered as living elsewhere to leave the city before a deadline. Otherwise, they will face being deported to the Turkish cities they were first registered in when they arrived in the country. Istanbul governorship says that authorities will carry out regular identification checks to detect these individuals. The video released by pro-government writers and journalists received mixed reactions from Turkish citizens on social media.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed full support for Azerbaijan’s military operation in its ethnically Armenian breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey is an old ally of Azerbaijan and views Armenia as one of its main regional rivals. Ankara supplied Azerbaijan with combat drones and other military equipment that helped Baku win back swaths of the breakaway region in a short but brutal war three years ago. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had earlier said the new operation was sparked by “long-standing armed attacks and provocations” against Azerbaijani forces in the region. “As a result of the legitimate and justified concerns it has repeatedly expressed regarding the situation on the ground in the nearly three years since the end of the Second Karabakh War, Azerbaijan has had to take the measures it deems necessary on its own sovereign territory,” the Turkish ministry said. “We believe that ensuring the continuation of the comprehensive negotiation process between Azerbaijan and Armenia … is the only way to establish peace, security, prosperity and permanent stability in the region,” the Turkish statement said."

Speaking on Saturday in the wake of a resolution adopted by the European Parliament (EP) on September 13, Erdogan said he could break with a bloc that Ankara has hoped for years to join, but concrete steps have been few and far between, and accession talks are effectively frozen. The EP resolution adopted a report published by the European Commission last year and said that Turkey’s EU accession process “cannot be resumed” without a “drastic change of course” by Ankara. Erdogan responded by accusing the bloc of “making efforts to sever ties with Turkey”, adding: “We will make our evaluations against these developments, and if necessary, we can part ways with the EU.” The resolution also made several criticisms of Turkey, including of the elections held in May, human rights issues and its relationship with Russia. For its part, Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the resolution included “unjust accusations and prejudices”. Turkey has a customs union with the EU and has been a candidate for accession since 1995. The rhetoric in the EP’s resolution and the tone it used were in line with previous reports by the bloc when evaluating the political situation in Turkey, according to Sinan Ulgen, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Carnegie Europe. Although the EP has only limited influence on the bloc’s enlargement, it has requested the official suspension of the EU’s accession talks with Turkey multiple times in recent years in non-binding votes. In addition, several member states, such as Austria, France and Germany have in the past called for Turkey to have a different form of partnership with the bloc rather than full membership. Regardless, Ulgen said, it is not realistic to believe that Turkey’s full membership bid would officially end. “It would be hard to get the necessary support within the EU member states to end Turkey’s membership bid as there are many countries, such as Spain, Poland, Hungary, Greece and Finland, that traditionally back the membership prospect and the talks,” he said. The analyst said he also does not feel that Turkey would withdraw unilaterally from the process in spite of Erdogan’s remarks."

The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey have agreed to revive high-level contacts between their countries and seek “new approaches” to problems as part of an effort to improve ties between the two NATO neighbours, who have been at loggerheads over a string of decades-old disputes. Discussions between Greece’s Giorgos Gerapetritis and Turkey’s Hakan Fidan on Tuesday were held in a relatively friendly climate triggered by Greece sending assistance to Turkey following a devastating earthquake earlier this year and Turkey offering condolences after a deadly train accident in Greece. The meeting came as Ankara, in the throes of an economic downturn, is seeking a reset of its often-troubled relations with Western nations. Greece and Turkey are at odds over territorial claims in the Aegean Sea, energy exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean and the division of Cyprus, among other issues. The Greek and Turkish navies shadowed each other in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean for a whole summer after Turkey sent a survey ship to look for undersea oil and gas in waters Greece claims as its jurisdiction under international law. Turkey has accused Greece of deploying troops on Aegean islands close to the Turkish coast in violation of treaties. Greece says it needs to defend the islands against a potential attack from Turkey, noting Turkey has a sizeable military force on the western Turkish coast. Turkish officials said continued militarisation of the islands could lead to Turkey questioning their ownership while Erdogan went as far as to threaten to send missiles to Athens. Last year, Erdogan had pledged never to talk to Mitsotakis, furious at the Greek leader, who during a visit to the United States, called on Washington not to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. But relations between the two countries improved when Greece became one of the first to send rescue workers to Turkey after devastating earthquakes in February killed 50,000 people."

Turkish drone attacks in northern Iraq have killed seven members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), authorities said, as the country’s foreign minister met the president and prime minister of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). “A Turkish army drone struck a PKK vehicle, killing an official and two fighters”, the KRG’s counterterrorism services said on Thursday. The PKK has fought a rebellion against Turkey since 1984, and has bases inside KRG territory. While the attacks were not mentioned by either Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan or KRG Prime Minister Masour Barzani during a news conference after their meeting, Fidan did reference the fight against the PKK, and Ankara’s continuing military operation there, which began in April 2022. “We have settled this question in Turkey once and for all,” Fidan said. During a visit to the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Tuesday, Fidan had urged the federal government to brand the PKK a “terrorist” organisation, as it is labelled in Turkey, the European Union and the United States. Oil exports, which Turkey has blocked from the Kurdish region of northern Iraq since March, were also on the agenda for the Turkish delegation to the KRG, which included Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar. “We discussed a range of regional issues, including bilateral Iraq-Turkey relations and also with the Kurdistan Region, as well as the mechanism of exporting the Kurdistan region’s oil,” Barzani said in the joint news conference with Fidan. Neither official gave any further information on Iraq’s northern oil exports and did not say if a deal had been reached to resume crude flows through Turkey. Turkey halted flows on March 25 after an arbitration ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered Ankara to pay Baghdad damages of $1.5 billion for unauthorised exports by the KRG between 2014 and 2018. Iraq – the second-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) – had filed for arbitration against Turkey in 2014 after the KRG sidelined Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) and began exporting crude oil through the neighbouring country."

Turkey’s central bank on Thursday raised the interest rate to 25 percent in a surprise move that signals a continued move away from previous policy, which focused on keeping interest rates low. The Turkish lira gained 1.5 percent against the dollar after the bank’s clear signal that it was stepping up its fight against inflation and attempts to support the troubled currency. Many economists disagreed with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s previous monetary policy, which was regarded as unorthodox. However, Erdogan infused his government with market-friendly faces after winning a difficult May election that came in the heat of one of Turkey’s most dire economic crises in decades. They also imposed a series of more technical steps aimed at balancing the economy and restoring the trust of both consumers and Turkey’s foreign investors."

Turkey expects the government in Iraq to officially recognise the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or the PKK, as a “terrorist” organisation, mirroring Ankara and its Western allies, its foreign minister says. Turkey’s top diplomat, Hakan Fidan, was in Baghdad on Tuesday on his first official visit since taking office. Fidan, whose visit is also aimed at preparing for an upcoming trip by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – which as yet does not have an official date – described the PKK as a common enemy. Baghdad has regularly complained that Turkish air attacks in northern Iraq constitute a violation of its sovereignty, despite Ankara’s claims that it is trying to face off a force that has “occupied” parts of Iraq. On Wednesday, Turkish intelligence announced that a PKK member had been “neutralised” in Sulaimaniyah, having been training for assassinations against security forces in Turkey. The PKK, designated a “terrorist” group by the European Union and the United States as well as Turkey, launched an armed rebellion in southeast Turkey in 1984, in which more than 40,000 people have since been killed. Turkey also targets the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which it considers to be the Syrian branch of the PKK. The Iraqi foreign minister on Tuesday did not directly discuss Baghdad’s plans in dealing with the PKK, but the issue has increasingly come to the fore in recent months as northern Iraq and Syria have seen intensified combat between Kurdish fighters and Turkey and groups under its support. The issue is also expected to feature prominently when Erdogan visits Iraq, with oil exports to Turkey a central issue for northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region for years. In an effort to bolster its autonomy, the Kurdish region in 2014 decided to unilaterally export oil to Turkey’s Ceyhan to generate an independent revenue stream. The plan was dealt a major blow in March this year when the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris ruled that Ankara violated an old treaty with Baghdad that gives the Iraqi federal government sole authority over Iraq’s oil sales through pipelines to Turkey. In response, Ankara shut down the pipeline on its territory, which the Kurdish government had been using to pump oil."

Indeed, Ottoman imperial history in the Arab world cannot be boiled down to a “Turkish occupation” or a “foreign yoke”. The Istanbul branch of the family, known as Azmzades, also held key positions in the palace, the various ministries and commissions, and later in the Ottoman parliament during the reign of Abdülhamid II and the second Ottoman constitutional period. The Malhamés were acting as commercial and political power brokers in cities like Istanbul, Beirut, Sofia and Paris. Some of them held positions that ranged from diplomats negotiating on behalf of the sultan with imperial counterparts in Europe, Russia, and Africa to advisers who planned and executed major imperial projects, such as the implementation of public health measures in Istanbul and the construction of a railway linking the Hijaz region in the Arabian Peninsula with Syria and the capital. These are also stories of better-known families like some of al-Khalidis and al-Abids, notable Arab-Ottoman political families who called Istanbul home, but maintained households and familial connections in Aleppo, Jerusalem, and Damascus. Their recent history was replaced by a short summary that painted “the Turk” as a foreign Other, the Arab Revolt as a war of liberation, and Western colonial occupation as an inevitable conclusion to the disintegration of “the sick man of Europe”. We must ask ourselves why is it that researchers from Arabic-speaking-majority countries frequent French and English imperial archives, but do not spend the time or the resources to learn Ottoman-Turkish in order to take advantage of four centuries worth of records readily available at the Ottoman imperial archives in Istanbul or local archives in former provincial capitals? Have we bought into the nationalist understanding of history in which Ottoman-Turkish and the Ottoman past belong solely to Turkish national historiography? Are we still the victim of a century’s worth of short-sighted political interests that ebb and flow as regional tensions between Arab countries and Turkey rise and fall?"

At least six Turkish soldiers have been killed in clashes with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters in northern Iraq, Turkey’s defence ministry has said. The fighting took place on Wednesday and in the early hours of Thursday in Zap, a region where Turkey has been carrying out a cross-border operation called “Claw-Lock” since April 2022. Turkish air attacks on PKK positions followed, leaving four PKK fighters dead, according to the ministry. Ankara says the offensive is a measure to prevent the PKK from using Iraq as a base to carry out attacks in Turkey. “Our soldiers will not leave the blood of the martyrs on the ground,” Turkish Colonel Zeki Akturk said at a news conference on Thursday, adding that Turkish forces “will continue their fight against terrorism with the same determination until there is not a single terrorist left”. The PKK, which has bases around northern Iraq, is designated a “terrorist” group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. The group launched an insurgency in southeast Turkey in 1984 in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. Turkey has also targeted members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Iraq. The SDF is largely made up of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey considers the Syrian branch of the PKK. Turkey has several bases across northern Iraq, despite opposition from the central Iraqi government, which has frequently condemned the military presence and described it as illegal. However, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which administers the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, has not publically condemned the Turkish presence, and the Claw-Lock operation began only two days after a visit by the KRG’s prime minister, Masrour Barzani, to Turkey. Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which has promoted close economic ties with Turkey, has an uneasy relationship with the PKK."

Turkey’s governing party has criticised a reported decision by Walt Disney Co’s Disney+ not to broadcast a documentary series about modern Turkey’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk on its streaming service. Ebubekir Sahin, chairman of Turkey’s television watchdog RTUK, announced the probe on Tuesday night in a statement, describing Ataturk as “our most important social value”. The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) called on Disney+ in June to cancel the show, saying that it “glorifies a Turkish dictator and genocide killer”. Last month, Disney+ Turkey announced the Ataturk series would be on air “very soon”. Several Turkish and Armenian news reports said Disney had decided to cancel the series, including the Armenian independent media outlet 301, saying the decision was influenced by the lobbying activities of ANCA. In May 1915, Ottoman commanders began the mass deportation of Armenians from eastern Turkey. Turkey has disputed the number, but acknowledges that killings did take place. However, Turkey has said that deaths occurred on all sides in the context of the conflict going on at the time, and refuses to recognise the deaths as a “genocide”. Mustafa Kemal – later known as Ataturk – was a commander at the Gallipoli campaign of World War I in 1915, and later went on to establish the Republic of Turkey in 1923, after he ended the Ottoman Empire. Armenians constituted a large minority in what is now modern-day Turkey for centuries, but only a small number remain, with the descendants of those who fled in 1915 living in other countries in the Middle East, and in the West. Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkey’s governing Justice and Development Party, or AKP, called it a “shame” that Disney+ had “succumbed to the pressure of the Armenian lobby” in reportedly cancelling the series. “This attitude of the platform in question is disrespectful to the values of the Republic of Turkey and our nation,” Celik said in a social media post."

The referral system had stopped after the devastating earthquakes that hit Turkey and Syria in February, but resumed again on June 5.

Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attended the signing ceremony for the drones deal between Turkish defence firm Baykar and the Saudi defence ministry, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. Erdogan’s visit comes as Turks are hit with sales and fuel tax hikes that Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has said are necessary to restore fiscal discipline and bring inflation down. Turkey’s current account deficit reached record levels this year – $37.7bn in the first five months – and Erdogan hopes the oil and gas-rich Gulf states will help plug the gap.

Turkey has recently repaired ties with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates following a decade-long rift after the 2011 Arab Spring and Ankara’s support for the Muslim Brotherhood, considered a threat by some Gulf monarchies. Worsening relations were exacerbated by a boycott of Turkish ally Qatar by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain in 2017. The 2018 murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul led to a further souring of ties with Riyadh. Qatar and the UAE have provided Turkey with some $20bn in currency swap agreements recently, while Saudi Arabia deposited $5bn into Turkey’s central bank in March.

Saudi Arabia’s state-run Al Ekhbariya TV aired footage of the Turkish president appearing at a Saudi-Turkish business forum. “During our visits, our primary agenda will be joint investment and commercial activities with these countries in the upcoming period,” Erdogan said before leaving Istanbul. Ties between the two countries were strained by the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate. Turkey angered Saudi Arabia by vigorously pursuing the case at the time, opening an investigation and briefing international media on the gory details of the killing.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he is open to talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad but would not meet him if a withdrawal of Turkish troops from Syrian territory were set as a condition. Speaking to reporters in Istanbul on Monday ahead of his departure for a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Erdogan said Turkey has never “shut the door” to discussions with the Syrian government. Turkey has been the biggest military and political ally of the Syrian opposition, which controls the last rebel-held bastion in the country, which is in northwest Syria on the Turkish border. Ankara has set up dozens of bases and deployed thousands of troops in northern Syria, preventing the Russian-backed Syrian army from re-taking the region. Turkey has also been a base for Syrian opposition groups since 2011. However, Damascus’s condition of a complete withdrawal of Turkish forces for such a meeting is “unacceptable”, he said. Erdogan first said this year that he might meet al-Assad as part of a new peace process, but al-Assad said in March that there was no point in a meeting with Erdogan until Turkey’s “illegal occupation” ended. Turkey has said its military operations in Syria have been necessary to secure its southern border. It is trying to remove fighters with the YPG, the Kurdish People’s Defence Units, which Ankara has said is the Syrian branch of the PKK, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. The PKK has fought a war against the Turkish state since 1984 – a conflict that has led to tens of thousands of deaths. The defence ministers of Turkey and Syria met late last year for the highest level talks between the two neighbours since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings plunged Syria into war and put it and Turkey at odds. The foreign ministers of the two countries also met in Moscow in May ahead of Turkish elections as part of talks overseen by Russia. The restoration of ties with Damascus quickened its pace after the deadly February 6 earthquakes in southern Turkey and northwestern Syria and the Chinese-brokered re-establishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had backed opposing sides in the Syrian conflict."

Under the guise of promoting education and inter-religious dialogue, FETÖ members infiltrated the army, law enforcement, the judiciary and numerous government institutions with the aim of illicitly taking control of the Turkish state. As of now, 20 schools have been transferred to the Turkish Maarif Foundation. This has broken the back of the criminal elements who wished to weaponise the goodwill of the Turkish nation for nefarious purposes. It was a monumental undertaking that the Turkish people deeply appreciated. Considering the synergy between a mature, engaged democracy and the level of citizens’ political commitment, high turnout in the elections proves that the Turkish people are unwavering in exercising their political will as masters of their country. Similarly, Türkiye will always be deeply grateful to our brother country Qatar, and His Highness the Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for standing in solidarity with the Turkish people during that difficult ordeal and being the first among the world’s leaders to condemn the attempted coup."

The UN-brokered agreement that allows for the delivery of aid overland from Turkey into rebel-held areas of Syria expired on Monday. February’s massive earthquakes that hit southern Turkey and northern Syria exposed the fragility of the cross-border mechanism and increased scrutiny of the UN’s humanitarian mission in Syria.

Sweden’s highest court has rejected extradition requests for two men wanted by Turkey, saying the Scandinavian country does not criminalise the act they are accused of committing. The men, who are refugees in Sweden but otherwise were not identified, cannot be sent to Turkey because “the requirement of dual criminality is not met”, the Swedish Supreme Court said in a statement on Thursday. Turkey claims the two men have joined the movement of United States-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen “by downloading and using a mobile application, which is used by the movement’s members”. Turkey blames Gulen for the failed 2016 coup and lists his network as a terror organisation. In May, Sweden tightened its antiterrorism laws, a move that was expected to help persuade Turkey to approve the Nordic nation’s request to join NATO. On Monday, NATO member Turkey withdrew its objections to Sweden joining the military alliance after a year of blocking Sweden’s bid. The decision by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was a significant move towards Sweden’s membership."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been busy at a NATO summit in Lithuania, surprising observers after reversing course and approving Sweden’s long-awaited bid to join the military bloc. At a press conference late on Wednesday following the summit in the capital of Vilnius, Erdogan touched on several issues for Turkey, including ratifying Sweden’s NATO bid, its F-16 jet defence deal with the United States, and the balancing act it continues to play between Russia and Ukraine. Turkey is forging new paths in Europe, also resuming talks with Greece, the two announced on the same day, after more than a year of tensions between the historic foes. Erodgan’s NATO play is ahead of his visit to the Gulf countries next week, a trip the leader is taking in part to drum up foreign funding to boost Turkey’s strained economy after his re-election in May. The Turkish leader said that he will forward the ratification of Sweden’s NATO bid to parliament when it reopens from October, with Stockholm to provide a road map of the steps it will take before the ratification is sent. Ankara’s approval came as Sweden pledged support for updating Turkey’s customs agreement with the European Union and its desire to have visa-free travel throughout the EU for its citizens. Hours after Ankara said it would allow Stockholm into the bloc, the US said it will proceed with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, the likely trade-off for Ankara’s green light. Turkey has long sought to buy the warplanes in a bid to update its existing fleet, alongside modernisation kits. Russia reacted with scorn over Turkey’s role in brokering the release of the five commanders, saying it violated the terms of a prisoner exchange deal engineered last year. Erdogan also said at the conference that Turkey could act as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv to end the invasion of Ukraine that began in February last year. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin currently has no plans to speak with Ankara’s leader, according to Russia’s TASS news agency, which cited the Kremlin spokesman."

On Wednesday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who were both recently re-elected, met on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. “But today’s meeting confirmed my intention and that of President Erdogan to reset Greek-Turkish relations.” Last year, Erdogan halted bilateral talks in a dispute over airspace violations and accused Mitsotakis of pressuring the United States to block the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara. But relations between the two countries improved when Greece became one of the first to send rescue workers to Turkey after devastating earthquakes in February left 50,000 people dead. Greece’s then-Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias was also the first European minister to visit Turkey after the quake. “We have no strategic benefit in having Turkey at odds with the West, the EU and the United States,” Mitsotakis said on Wednesday. He acknowledged that the earthquake cooperation “brought many changes in the psychology” of Greek-Turkish relations. So-called earthquake diplomacy also came into play in 1999, when two deadly quakes struck Turkey and Greece within a month of each other."

Turkey has agreed to allow Sweden to join NATO after closed-door negotiations between NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the leaders of the two countries ahead of a NATO summit in Lithuania. Hours after Ankara’s decision was revealed, the administration of United States President Joe Biden announced it will move forward with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey in consultation with the US Congress, in what seemed to be a trade-off for Ankara’s green light to Stockholm’s NATO membership. Separately, the Pentagon said on Tuesday that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed his country’s role in Turkey’s military modernisation with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler on the phone – another indication that negotiations over Sweden’s entry were helped along by a US-Turkey defence deal. Ankara sought to purchase US F-16s and modernise the ones it already owns as compensation for its 2019 removal from a US-led international programme developing and producing new F-35 fighter jets. Washington sacked Turkey from the popular scheme after its purchase of the S-400 defence system from Russia despite warnings from the US. The development led to a bilateral crisis between the two allies and Washington’s imposition of sanctions on Turkey in December 2020 in the area of defence under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) – the first time such sanctions targeted a NATO member. This made Ankara’s veto on Sweden’s NATO bid a thorn in an already rocky relationship with the West for more than a year. According to Galip Dalay, a non-resident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, Sweden’s membership of NATO has been a subheading in Turkey’s agenda towards the West, and more specifically towards the US. “Ankara’s expectations over F-16s from Washington have been apparent in this process from day one. However, Turkey also sought a general normalisation and improvement in its relations with the EU countries and the US in general through Sweden’s process, using it as a peg,” Dalay told Al Jazeera."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to back Sweden’s bid to join NATO after a year of blocking the move, citing Turkish security concerns. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Monday that Erdogan agreed to forward Sweden’s membership bid to Turkey’s parliament. After talks in Vilnius, Lithuania, with Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Stoltenberg said Turkey had agreed to move forward. Turkey has held up Sweden’s NATO accession since last year, accusing Stockholm of harbouring Kurdish activists Ankara regards as “terrorists”. A series of demonstrations in Stockholm, including stunts by anti-Islam activists who burned the Quran, also angered Turkish officials. A joint statement issued after three-way talks stated Turkey and Sweden would work closely on “counterterrorism coordination” and boost trade ties. Earlier on Monday, Erdogan had upped the stakes further by demanding that the European Union revive Turkey’s stalled membership bid as a condition for Sweden to join NATO. “Turkey has been waiting at the door of the European Union for over 50 years now, and almost all of the NATO member countries are now members of the European Union,” Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul. “I am making this call to these countries that have kept Turkey waiting at the gates of the European Union for more than 50 years. Come and open the way for Turkey’s membership in the European Union. When you pave the way for Turkey, we’ll pave the way for Sweden as we did for Finland.”"

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he would back Sweden’s NATO candidacy if the European Union resumes long-stalled membership talks with Ankara. “First, open the way for Turkey’s membership in the European Union, and then we will open it for Sweden, just as we had opened it for Finland,” Erdogan said in a televised media appearance on Monday before departing for the NATO summit in Lithuania. The Turkish leader said he told the same thing to US President Joe Biden when the pair spoke by phone on Sunday. Turkey wants Sweden to crack down on groups that it considers national security threats, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which Ankara considers the Syrian branch of the PKK. Ankara also wants Stockholm to extradite suspects whom it calls “terrorists” and lift an arms ban it has imposed on Turkey. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that while he supports Ankara’s EU membership, as far as he was concerned, Sweden had already met the conditions required to join NATO. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also said Turkey’s stance is a positive development. “This is what I’m taking as the positive message from the Turkish president’s comments.” Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Istanbul, said Sweden argues that Turkey’s requests cannot be decided by the government’s executive branch but by the judiciary. Turkey first applied to become a member of the European Economic Community, a predecessor to the EU, in 1987. The talks stalled in 2016 over European concerns about human rights violations in Turkey. “Turkey has been waiting at the EU’s front door for 50 years.” I now am addressing these countries, which are making Turkey wait for more than 50 years, and I will address them again in Vilnius.” Patrick Ruby, a defence analyst, said there is increasing pressure on Turkey from numerous parties in the military alliance led by Biden. “It looks like so far Turkey has not shifted yet” towards backing Sweden’s membership, he told Al Jazeera."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has returned home, from a visit to Turkey, with five commanders of Ukraine’s former garrison in Mariupol, a move Russia said violated the terms of a prisoner exchange deal engineered last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday that Ankara had promised under the exchange agreement to keep the men in Turkey and complained that Moscow had not been informed of the move. “We are returning home from Turkey and bringing our heroes home,” said Zelenskyy, who met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for talks in Istanbul on Friday. Russia freed some of them in September last year in a prisoner swap brokered by Ankara under terms that required the commanders to remain in Turkey until the end of the war. Zelenskyy gave no explanation for why the commanders were being allowed to return home now and there was no immediate comment from Turkey. The Kremlin, however, accused Ukraine and Turkey of violating agreements by releasing the commanders. “The return of the leaders of the Azovites from Turkey to Ukraine is nothing more than a direct violation of the terms of the existing agreements. Moreover, in this case, the terms were violated by both the Ukrainian side and the Turkish side,” said Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. According to the agreements, these ringleaders were to remain on the territory of Turkey until the end of the conflict,” he said. Peskov added that the release was a result of heavy pressure from Turkey’s NATO allies ahead of next week’s summit of the military alliance at which Ukraine hopes to receive a positive sign about its future membership. Analysts said the return of the soldiers could strain Turkey’s relations with Russia. Ankara has so far managed to maintain a delicate balancing act, even helping broker a deal with Russia last year that allowed the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian ports. “Turkey’s a member of NATO, which has been backing Zelenskyy and Ukraine in the war."

Turkey supports Ukraine’s NATO membership aspirations, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but he also urged for a “return to peace efforts” to end the conflict that has now raged for 500 days since Russia invaded Ukraine last year. “There is no doubt that Ukraine deserves membership of NATO,” Erdogan told a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president in Istanbul early on Saturday, adding that the two sides should go back to peace talks. “A fair peace creates no losers,” the Turkish leader said, according to the Reuters news agency. Zelenskyy’s talks in Turkey were being watched closely by the Kremlin, which has tried to break its international isolation by cultivating strong relations with the Turkish leader Erdogan. Though the Turkish leader reaffirmed his longstanding call for the two sides to enter peace negotiations, Erdogan risked drawing the ire of Putin by delivering unequivocal support for Ukraine’s NATO aspiration. Erdogan said Putin will visit Turkey next month and that he and the Russian president would discuss possible prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine, which Erdogan has helped to arrange in the past. Erdogan also said that he would push Putin to extend a deal that Turkey and the United Nations had brokered last year under which Ukraine was able to ship grain to the global market from ports on the Black Sea."

A Swedish court has found a man guilty of attempting to finance the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), in a ruling that could help end Turkey’s veto of Sweden’s application to join the NATO military alliance. Ankara accuses Sweden of harbouring members of “militant” groups on its territory and says it must crack down on them before it can join NATO. The PKK, deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union – to which Sweden belongs – and the United States, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. The Stockholm district court sentenced Yahya Gungor, a 41-year-old Turkish Kurd, to four years and six months in prison for gun crime, attempted extortion and attempted funding of terrorism, the verdict showed. Thursday’s court verdict came as the foreign ministers of Sweden and Turkey were meeting in Brussels to discuss Stockholm’s NATO accession bid. US President Joe Biden on Wednesday expressed support for Sweden’s bid to join NATO during talks with Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson amid concerns that Turkey may not lift its veto in time for the defence alliance’s summit in Lithuania next week. Sweden says it has fulfilled demands agreed upon in negotiations with Turkey, including introducing a new bill that makes being a member of a “terrorist organisation” illegal.

In a joint statement released by the Turkish foreign ministry on Tuesday, the two governments said Turkey nominated Salih Mutlu Sen as its ambassador to Cairo and Egypt appointed Amr Elhamamy as its envoy to Ankara. “This step aims at the renormalisation of relations between the two countries and reflects the mutual will to improve bilateral relations in the interests of the Turkish and Egyptian peoples,” the statement said. Relations between Cairo and Ankara were severed in 2013 after then-military commander and current Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led a coup to remove President Mohamed Morsi, a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, a political Islamist group active in multiple countries. Morsi, the country’s first democratically elected president, had the support of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which was close to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mensur Akgun, a professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Kultur University, said ties between two key regional players have been exceedingly poor since the 2013 coup in particular because of Ankara’s unbending stance against the government of el-Sisi, who became president in 2014. Senior foreign ministry officials from the two countries have held talks since 2021, and rapprochement efforts between Turkey and Egypt took a turn after el-Sisi and Erdogan shook hands at the World Cup in Qatar in late 2022. Talks with Cairo were part of Ankara’s recent foreign policy initiative to repair relations with other regional powers, such as the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Before Ankara started efforts to fix its ties in the region, issues of disagreement between Ankara and Cairo included sharing hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean, the conflict in Libya, the war in Syria and a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf. Turkey backed Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Doha in June 2017 in a development that created clear rival regional alliances. Akgun said the resolution of the Gulf crisis in 2021 has been a catalyst for Ankara to repair its ties with regional powers. “Qatar and Turkey are key geopolitical partners, and Ankara would never enhance its ties with the blockading countries to its current levels if the Gulf crisis was not resolved,” he said."

Erdogan told Stoltenberg in a phone call on Sunday that Turkey had a constructive attitude, but Sweden’s change of “terrorism” laws to meet demands from Ankara was “meaningless” while PKK supporters continued to hold protests in the country, the Turkish presidency said in a statement. Turkey has objected to Sweden’s bid to join the Western military alliance, citing security concerns, but members of the bloc and NATO chief have expressed hope that it will become a member in time for a mid-July summit in Vilnius. Finland joined NATO in April but Turkey continues to block Sweden’s membership. Last week, Erdogan said it should not expect a green light from Ankara at the Vilnius summit unless it prevents “anti-Turkey” protests. Ankara says Sweden harbours members of “terrorist” groups in the country, in particular belonging to the PKK, which has been designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. Sweden recently introduced a new law to make it harder to finance or support “terrorist groups”, which Ankara said was not convincing enough. Swedish foreign minister Tobias Billstrom on Wednesday said Turkey’s parliament should begin ratifying Sweden’s bid because Stockholm has met its obligations under a deal with Ankara."

Since 2013, Turkey has been embroiled in “political storms”, says Murat Okcu, a professor of economics and administrative sciences at Suleyman Demirel University. “In addition to the Gezi events [in 2013] and major political storms, such as [the] July 15 [coup attempt], the economic crises that emerged with the 2018-dollar rate attacks and the pandemic are the political and economic storms which marked Turkey’s last 10 years,” Okcu said. Alkin, the rector of Istanbul Topkapi University, says diplomatic mistakes or internal politics were automatically reflected in the stock market and interest rate reactions. This system, in line with the country’s “Century of Turkiye” vision, was an attempt to create an independent economy, freeing Turkey from global tutelage. Alkin says the next step should be to increase Turks’ purchasing power, at least enough to eliminate the high inflation and cost of living caused by high exchange rates, which he predicts will take at least 18 months."

But Erdogan signalled no major shift in comments on Wednesday released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Finland became NATO’s 31st member in April after the Turkish parliament ratified its request, but Turkey has held off on approving Sweden’s bid. The officials in Ankara discussed what Finland and Sweden have done to address Turkey’s concerns over what it calls “terrorist” groups and their supporters living in the Nordic nations. Erdogan said earlier that the Turkish delegation at the meeting gave the message: “Don’t expect anything different at Vilnius.” Sweden’s chief negotiator said on Wednesday that Turkey and Sweden will continue their discussions but added there was no specific date. “But Turkey is not ready to make a decision yet and thinks that they need to have more answers to the questions they have.” Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too lenient towards groups that Ankara says pose a security threat, including Kurdish armed organisations and people accused of associations with a failed coup attempt against Erdogan’s government in 2016. A series of demonstrations in Stockholm, including a protest by an anti-Islam activist who burned the Quran outside the Turkish embassy, also angered Turkish officials. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has said his government has done what it promised in an agreement reached with Turkey last year, which was intended to secure Ankara’s ratification of its NATO membership. Last week, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström was told by his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, that Ankara needed to see more “concrete steps” from Sweden.

According to the United Nations refugee agency, the vast majority of refugees in Turkey – 3.6 million – are Syrians living under temporary protection. About 200,000 have been granted Turkish citizenship since the Syrian war broke out in 2011, according to government figures. Although al-Abdullah was barely a teenager when he came to Turkey in 2015, he said the family felt that they were well received at first, as Syrians and Turks in the southeast share a similar culture and traditions. The situation gradually deteriorated because of a widening economic crisis that saw soaring inflation and a collapse of Turkey’s currency, which in turn contributed to an increasing anti-migrant sentiment among the Turkish public. “Some Turkish people I know told me that Erdogan won because of our votes. “At least [under Erdogan] I feel like I can be involved in Turkish politics like a Turk, not just as a Syrian. “We are like our Turkish counterparts: We are useful to the economy and are here to stay, not to create problems.” The day after the run-off there was a palpable sense of relief on the streets of Inonu Caddesi, Gaziantep’s Syrian-majority neighbourhood that is full of shops with Turkish and Arabic signs. “I’m relieved, but just in theory,” said Mustafa Kara Ali, a photographer from Idlib who moved to Turkey in 2018 with his wife and two young daughters, in front of the shop where he usually buys Syrian desserts. Most of the Syrian population in Turkey live along its southern border, closer to their homeland."

Turkish foreign policy is set,” said Konstantinos Filis, director of the Institute of Global Affairs at the American College of Greece. Before Erdogan came to power in 2003, Turkey had already threatened Greece with war if it should exercise its right under the UN Law of the Sea to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles off its islands in the Aegean (both countries currently claim 6 nautical miles). There are thousands of Greek islands in the Aegean, but only a handful of Turkish ones. Turkish territorial waters would rise from 7.5 percent of the Aegean to 8.7 percent. In 1996, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller launched a policy of disputing uninhabited Greek islets. When she put Turkish commandos on one of those islands, Imia, the two countries came to the brink of war. Greece and Turkey had already been on a war footing since 1974 when Turkey invaded Cyprus in response to a coup attempt on the island launched by a colonels’ dictatorship then ruling Greece. Erdogan came to power in 2003, when Greece and Turkey were in the midst of historic talks that were supposed to settle their maritime border disagreements and open a path for Turkey to join the European Union. The talks meandered, and Turkey’s EU prospects dimmed because of opposition from France and Germany. A 2018 alliance between Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP) stiffened Turkish foreign policy. Relations between Greece and Turkey began to visibly decline in December 2017, when Erdogan visited Athens and announced he wanted to revise the Lausanne Treaty, which set the boundaries between the two countries in 1923. He left relations worse than they were when he arrived, but upon his return to Ankara, Kilicdaroglu baited him. Erdogan’s political fate seemed in peril after two earthquakes killed tens of thousands of people in early February, and Turkish opposition leaders blamed him for not enforcing building codes. “The Turks are used to him."

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s victory in Turkey’s unprecedented run-off on May 28 was welcomed by officials in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as it would bring a sense of continuity and strengthen relations between Ankara and the bloc as well as its six members. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was the first foreign head of state to congratulate Erdogan, who has taken office for his third presidential term, and other Gulf leaders quickly followed suit, expressing their desire to bolster ties with Turkey. Erdogan, 69, whose two-decade rule will be extended for another five years, is expected to visit the Gulf soon in a reflection of how important GCC members have been to Turkey’s foreign policy agenda. Between now and 2028, the GCC states can expect business as usual in their dealings with Ankara. Turkey’s strong alliance with Qatar will likely continue to deepen while Erdogan also looks to expand relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as Ankara’s rapprochement with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continues to gain speed. “It is likely that the Turkish-Gulf relations will continue to have a personalised nature as it has been in the past two decades,” Sinem Cengiz, a researcher at Qatar University and Arab News columnist, told Al Jazeera. Erdogan’s re-election was a relief to many Gulf officials because his challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu would have likely changed Turkey’s foreign policy towards the GCC in ways that could have undermined their interests. Qatar, in particular, had reason to fear a downgrading of its relationship with Ankara had Kilicdaroglu won. Ankara will continue placing much value on its economic, political and security ties with the wealthy GCC countries, important to Turkey’s trade and defence markets. Closer Emirati-Turkish economic links will also provide the two countries, which have two of the Middle East’s largest economies, opportunities to unlock vast amounts of investment that can help both economies grow. A few days after Erdogan secured another term, Turkey and the UAE ratified a cooperation agreement that aims to increase their bilateral trade to $40bn in the next five years."

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged Turkey not to veto Sweden’s bid to join the military alliance, ahead of a meeting this month to try to overcome objections delaying Stockholm’s membership. “Membership will make Sweden safer but also make NATO and Turkey stronger,” Secretary-General Stoltenberg told journalists in Istanbul on Sunday after meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his newly appointed foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, the former head of the intelligence agency. Officials from Turkey, Sweden and Finland will meet next week to attempt to resolve the issues that have delayed Sweden’s NATO membership, said Stoltenberg, referring to the permanent joint mechanism set up to address Turkey’s concerns about Sweden and Finland. In March, Turkey ratified Finland’s bid for membership, and it became NATO’s 31st member in April. Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too lenient on “terrorist” organisations and security threats, including Kurdish groups and people associated with a 2016 coup attempt. “Sweden has taken significant concrete steps to meet Turkey’s concerns,” said Stoltenberg, noting that the country has amended its constitution, strengthened its anti-“terror” laws, and lifted an arms embargo on Turkey since it applied to join NATO just over a year ago. As Stoltenberg held talks in Istanbul, hundreds of people, including dozens of pro-Kurdish protesters, gathered in Stockholm to demonstrate against Sweden’s planned NATO membership. “I understand it is hard to see demonstrations against Turkey and against NATO in Sweden,” Stoltenberg said. On Saturday, Stoltenberg attended the inauguration in Ankara of Erdogan, who was re-elected to serve a third presidential term and another five years in office."
Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/news/2023/6/4/simsek,Can market veteran Simsek pull Turkey’s economy back from brink?,4 Jun 2023,"Mehmet Simsek, a former Turkish finance chief popular among foreign investors, has taken the helm of the economy again, signalling a return to more orthodox economic policies. The United Kingdom-educated Simsek, a former strategist at London-based Merrill Lynch, was appointed treasury and finance minister on Saturday as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced his new cabinet after winning the May 28 presidential run-off that extended his rule for five more years and into a third decade. Turkey is in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis stemming from soaring inflation, which peaked at 85.5 percent in October compared with a year ago before easing to 43.7 percent in April with a favourable base effect. The Turkish lira has lost some 150 percent of its value in the last two years as the country’s $900bn economy came under immense pressure amid depleted foreign reserves, a swiftly increasing current account deficit, and a snowballing state-backed scheme of lira deposits protected against the currency’s depreciation. He said during a handover ceremony on Sunday that the country “has no other choice than to return to a rational ground” and that a “rules-based, predictable Turkish economy will be the key to achieving the desired prosperity”. Erdogan named Cevdet Yilmaz – another cabinet member who backs orthodox economic policies – as Turkey’s vice president. Simsek said on Sunday that the government’s main purpose is to increase social welfare in Turkey. Ceyhun Elgin, a professor of economics at Istanbul’s Bogazici University, said Simsek is expected to pursue a monetary policy aiming for low inflation rather than credit expansion and growth. Elgin added that the new minister would not abolish the lira deposits scheme protected against foreign currencies amid depleted foreign currency reserves, but that he might do so “after Turkey’s foreign reserves reach a certain level with the influence of increasing interest rates”. The indirect state controls on the lira’s exchange rate against foreign reserve currencies are expected to be gradually lifted, Elgin said, leading to controlled depreciation of Turkey’s currency. Simsek said that it was vital for Turkey “to reduce inflation to single digits again in the medium term … and to speed up the structural transformation which will reduce the current account deficit”."

Turkey’s longest-serving leader faces considerable diplomatic challenges amid tensions with the West. Turkey’s transformative but divisive leader won the May 28 run-off against a powerful opposition coalition, and despite an economic crisis and criticism following a devastating February earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people. “He talked about a liberal and inclusive constitution and that’s important because he never talked in this way [before]… He also talked about the role of Turkey in the region as a peacemaker. He tried to show the key role of Turkey in world politics.” Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Ankara, said the inauguration ceremony was attended by at least 78 members of the international community. Turkey’s new members of parliament started being sworn in on Friday in their first session after the May 14 election, also attended by Erdogan. Meanwhile, NATO allies are anxiously waiting for Ankara to greenlight Sweden’s attempt to join the United States-led defence alliance before a summit in July. Erdogan has been dragging his feet on approving the application, accusing Stockholm of sheltering “terrorists” of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is listed as a terror group by Ankara and its Western allies. Sweden’s Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said on Twitter “a clear message” emerged at a NATO meeting in Oslo for Turkey and Hungary to start the ratification process. Erdogan became prime minister in 2003 after his AK Party won an election in late 2002 following Turkey’s worst economic crisis since the 1970s."

In this election, President Erdogan defeated not only the opposition candidate but the xenophobic and anti-refugee elements on the fringes of Turkish society whose support he relied on. By once again choosing President Erdogan, Turkish people clearly stated that they too believe refugees currently residing in Türkiye should return to their home countries only when it is safe to do so. Erdogan’s re-election also demonstrates the Turkish people’s support for and appreciation of their country’s resolute stance against terrorism.

Turkey has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a “terrorist” group.

In Turkey’s two previous direct presidential elections, Erdogan’s challengers had failed to break through the 40 percent barrier. Four years ago, the CHP, backed by other parties, took a clutch of major cities, including Istanbul and Ankara, which had been governed by Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) or its predecessors for 25 years. If CHP rebels converge in a bid to remove the 74-year-old former bureaucrat, they are likely to focus on Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu as his successor. Since winning Turkey’s largest city for the party, Imamoglu has become a household figure and played a significant role in the campaign, as did his Ankara counterpart Mansur Yavas. “That will give Erdogan enough time to build on his post-election victory and make people forget [by March’s local elections] that he’s jailed Istanbul’s popular mayor.” Turkey’s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said the ruling was not politically motivated.

Finland joined the US-led alliance last month, but Sweden’s membership has been held up by objections from Turkey and Hungary. Turkey says Stockholm harbours members of armed groups it considers to be “terrorists”. Meanwhile, Turkey has sought to buy $20bn worth of F-16s and nearly 80 modernisation kits from the US. But the sale has been stalled due to objections from US Congress over Ankara’s refusal to green light to NATO enlargement, its human rights record and Syria policy – even though the Biden administration has repeatedly said it supports the sale. A much smaller $259m package including avionics software upgrades for Turkey’s current fleet of F-16 fighter aircraft was cleared by US Congress earlier this year, days after Turkey ratified Finland’s NATO accession.

But the Turkish economy is in bad shape, and in his victory speech on Sunday night, Erdogan highlighted inflation as the primary problem facing the country. “Resolving the problems caused by the price increases and by inflation is the most urgent topic of the coming days,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Ankara. The value of Turkey’s currency, which the government had protected through selling foreign currency reserves, is dropping. Timothy Ash, a Turkey expert at London’s BlueBay Asset Management, said the currency’s current level was “just not sustainable”. But Emre Peker, Europe director at the Eurasia Group, said Erdogan is likely to see Sunday’s victory as an endorsement of his economic policies, which the president argues will make Turkey’s economy stronger in the long run. Peker added that Erdogan was motivated by a “desire to wean Turkey off its overall economic dependency on Western partners”. Turkey has been helped in recent months by money from Russia and Gulf countries. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have deposited billions of dollars with the Turkish central bank or set up multibillion-dollar investment funds. Russia has deferred payments for natural gas as well as providing billions towards Turkey’s first nuclear power station. “The current economic dynamics won’t be able to sustain Turkey’s needs,” Peker said. “Turkey will need more foreign inflows to manage its external payments and, given the negative interest rates, that’s hard to sustain.” Another subject requiring the president’s urgent attention as he starts his five-year term will be Turkey’s relations with its Western partners, in particular the issue of Sweden joining NATO. Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO members holding up Stockholm’s bid to join the defence alliance, made in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year. “We’re not ready for Sweden right now,” he said, citing Ankara’s concerns over Stockholm’s stance on what Turkey has labeled “terrorist” groups."
Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/news/2023/5/29/five-key-takeaways-from-turkeys-pivotal-election,Five key takeaways from Turkey’s pivotal election,29 May 2023,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has extended his leadership of Turkey into a third decade after he won re-election in a tense run-off. Here are five key takeaways from the results of Turkey’s vote: Erdogan was already Turkey’s longest-serving leader, but his election win extends his 20-year rule – he was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and then president – for a further five years. His influence on Turkey can now be rivalled only by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was president for 15 years, between 1923 and his death in 1938. Erdogan has been able to shape Turkish politics. In 2014, he became the first president elected by popular vote, going on to win a referendum that changed governance in Turkey to a presidential system. The political savvy that has contributed to his survival can perhaps be traced back to Erdogan’s younger days, and a career that began in the 1970s in Beyoglu, the Istanbul district that includes his childhood home in the working-class neighbourhood of Kasimpasa. He rose through the ranks, and in 1994, became mayor of Istanbul, where he addressed many of the problems facing the city’s rapidly growing population, such as air pollution, rubbish collection and a lack of clean water. But his rise led to a confrontation with the Turkish state, and even a period in prison and a political ban for publicly reading a politically-charged poem. For many supporters, particularly in Turkey’s Anatolian heartland and Black Sea region, he is the man who represents them – no matter what his critics say. And now many opposition politicians are looking to Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavas, the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, respectively, as future leaders. Looking at the electoral map in Turkey, it is clear that support for Kilicdaroglu came in Istanbul, Ankara and Turkey’s western Aegean coast, as well as the Kurdish-majority southeast. The president has lost support in recent years for a crackdown on the biggest pro-Kurdish party, the HDP, and military and security operations against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its affiliates in Turkey and beyond."

French President Emmanuel Macron said France and Turkey “will continue to move forward”. “France and Turkey have huge challenges to face together. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi called Erdogan’s re-election “a sign of continued valuable trust of Turkish people”. “Our relationship with Turkey in the next stage will continue on the basis of good neighbourliness and shared interests,” he added. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah described Erdogan’s “election victory” as a renewal of the Turkish people’s confidence in the president’s successful projects and policies. Dbeibah’s Tripoli-based Government of National Unity is backed by Turkey against an eastern-based rival government. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh lauded Erdogan and the Turkish people for their “election victory”. The head of Hamas’s political office Ismail Haniyeh said: “I congratulate President Erdogan on winning and I applaud the [Turkish] people’s civilised stance."

He had already outstripped the 15-year presidency of the Republic of Turkey’s founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Erdogan appeared outside his residence in Istanbul’s Uskudar, where he sang before thanking an adoring crowd. He then headed to Ankara, where he addressed supporters at the presidential palace. Official data shows that inflation in Turkey was at 50.5 percent in March, down from a high of 85.6 percent in October. For Turks following the opening of ballot boxes on television, the results depended on which platform they were following – the state-run Anadolu news agency or the Anka agency, which has ties to the opposition. The elections – a parliamentary poll was run alongside the leadership race on May 14 – were widely billed as the most important in recent Turkish history and took place during the centenary year of the republic’s foundation. The polls, in which more than 64 million Turks at home and abroad were entitled to vote, took place against a background of a cost-of-living crisis that saw inflation peak at 85 percent in October and earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 people in the country’s southeast. Having endured the last two months of campaigning, voters now have 10 months to steel themselves for local elections in March, when Erdogan will push to retake cities including Istanbul and Ankara that were taken by the opposition in 2019."

Erdogan said in Ankara that his government will allocate all its time and energy to producing results after the polls. He added that healing the wounds of the February earthquakes, rebuilding Turkey’s destroyed cities and connecting its people to life will continue to be the country’s priorities. The HDP backed Kilicdaroglu against Erdogan this time around, leading to large support for the CHP leader in eastern Turkey, which is largely Kurdish. Erdogan has framed Kilicdaroglu’s ties to the HDP as evidence of support from “terrorists” – as he links the HDP to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an armed group that has fought the Turkish state since 1984. Erdogan has said in Ankara that the election result “has a place above our heads”, using a Turkish phrase to indicate respect for the result. The winner is Turkey. Playing on the theme of the ‘century of Turkey’ mentioned earlier, Erdogan says that his supporters will build Turkey’s future together. God willing, we will continue to build and rejuvenate the ‘century of Turkey’ together.” The United States and Turkey have had a rocky relationship over the last few years, with significant differences over Syria and Turkey’s purchase of a missile system from Russia, although tensions have since eased. Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Istanbul, has said that in the last couple of years, Turkey has been in the process of “rapprochement” with countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – nations that had previously had poor relations with Ankara following the Arab Spring. “And with Damascus even, just before the elections, we have seen direct meetings between the foreign minister of Turkey and Syria; these were the highest level meetings since the start of the Syrian crisis.” Turkey has troops in Syria and has supported the Syrian opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. President Erdogan has now arrived in Ankara, where his supporters have gathered by the thousands in front of the presidential palace, waiting for the leader to speak."

The presidential run-off between incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan and opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu marks the final moment in what has been widely billed as Turkey’s most important election in recent history. “Tomorrow, let’s all go to the polls together for the Great Turkey Victory,” he tweeted on Saturday. Let’s start the Century of Turkey with our votes.” The president later attended a ceremony in Istanbul to mark the anniversary of a 1960 coup that led to the execution of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, with whom Erdogan has often identified himself. In his final public appearance, the opposition leader told an Ankara meeting on family support that he would extend social security payments. As in the first round, Turkish citizens living overseas have completed casting their ballots before election day. Some 1.9 million voted in 73 countries and at border gates, where the ballot boxes remain open until voting closes in Turkey. The number of voters has been boosted by more than 47,500 voters who turned 18 over the past two weeks, taking the electorate in Turkey to nearly 60.8 million. By embracing Ozdag’s endorsement and turning to nationalist rhetoric, Kilicdaroglu has run the risk of alienating Kurdish voters who backed him in the first round, according to Berk Esen, a political scientist at Sabanci University in Istanbul. “One thing we can say with certainty is that identity politics dominated the campaign despite the deepest economic problems in Turkey since the 2001 financial crisis,” he said. February’s earthquakes, which killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, had also been expected to be a significant factor in pushing down Erdogan’s votes, with critics focusing on what the president himself admitted were mistakes in the government’s response to the disaster. “The challenge lies in getting a bigger slice of Turkey’s majority conservative and right-of-centre voters who make up anywhere between 60 and 65 percent of the electorate,” Peker said."

For all the updates and the results from Turkey’s presidential election, you can head over to our new live blog here. Turkey does not have exit polls, but preliminary results are expected to come within hours of polls closing. There have been several alleged incidents of voting irregularities across Turkey, including accusations of attacks on ballot observers and at least one report of a dead woman listed as eligible to vote. Aynur Usta said her mother, who died eight years ago, appeared on the voter list in Istanbul’s Bahcelievler suburb. Voting irregularities are not uncommon in Turkish elections, but are usually isolated incidents occurring in rural areas. Alleged breaches were also reported in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, Turkey’s three largest cities. In the early morning, voter turnout was low in Turkey’s southern city of Gaziantep, an electoral stronghold, due to rain but it eventually improved, according to Al Jazeera’s Amr Halabi. “Voters here, and in southern Turkey in general, are quite concerned about the refugee issue,” Halabi said. The office of Istanbul’s chief public prosecutor has launched an investigation into social media accounts that allegedly spread misinformation and provocative posts, according to state-run TRT. Erdogan supporters at Istanbul’s polls are confident that the president would secure a third term in office. “Tayyip Erdogan is the only leader who can represent Turkey on the world stage and look after our interests.” Referring to the 87 percent turnout in the first round, Sark said Turkey was “showing that we are the biggest democracy in the world”. Syrians who have experienced the horror of war firsthand eagerly await news from the Turkish presidential run-off, Al Jazeera’s Nour Qormosh reports from Idlib, a province in northwestern Syria. Many in the area, which borders Turkey, have family members across the border and want to know how the elections will affect them, Qormosh said. “I have many relatives living in Turkey and working to support their families here [in Idlib]."

Menderes was tried and hanged one year after the military staged a coup in 1960 to put Turkey back on a more secular course. But Erdogan’s failure to top the 50-percent threshold set up Turkey’s first run-off on Sunday and underscored the gradual ebbing of his support. Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Ankara, said Erdogan’s message has not changed significantly from the first round of the election. “He was making a promise to make the next century the century of Turkey. He was promising a more powerful and assertive Turkey in the international arena,” he said. Kilicdaroglu, who is heading up an opposition coalition of conservatives, secular parties and nationalists, ended his campaign with a speech at the “Family Support Insurance Meeting” in the capital, Ankara. We can’t even hold an election in Turkey. Observers have said Turkey’s votes are free of meddling on election days – but unfair because the odds are stacked against the opposition in advance. Another issue that has taken centre-stage in the lead-up to the elections has been the state of the economy, the growing alarm about the fate of Turkey’s beleaguered lira and the stability of its banks. Erdogan forced the central bank to follow through on his unconventional theory that lower interest rates bring down inflation, but Turkey’s annual inflation rate touched 85 percent last year while the lira entered a brief freefall."

Mesut Yegen, a professor of sociology at Istanbul’s Sehir University, said there is a voter bloc that wants to see neither main contender as president and is unimpressed with the mainstream political parties in Turkey today.

According to the United Nations, Turkey has taken in 3.7 million refugees, more than any other country in the world. The situation has left many Syrians in Turkey deeply worried about their future in the country. We all suffer from anxiety in this period,” said the man who was displaced eight years ago by Syria’s war and currently resides in Istanbul. According to the United Nations refugee agency, the vast majority of refugees in Turkey – 3.6 million – are Syrian living under “temporary protection status”. About 200,000 Syrians have been given Turkish citizenship since the Syrian war erupted in 2011, according to government figures. While Turkey initially welcomed the refugees, provided shelter and access to education with billions of euros in European Union funding, anti-refugee sentiment has grown in recent years, and refugees have become scapegoats for Turkey’s economic troubles, which has occasionally led to violence. Muhammad Siddik Yasar, who runs the Tarlabaşı Solidarity Association, a refugee solidarity group in Istanbul, said anti-refugee sentiment sharpened in the run-up to the elections. “Ogan is an interesting and important phenomenon in Turkish politics,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. This month, the foreign ministers of Turkey, Syria and Iran met in Moscow as part of the Kremlin’s efforts to broker a rapprochement between the Turkish and Syrian governments after years of antagonism over Syria’s war and multiple Turkish military operations in northern Syria. For his part, al-Assad has demanded that Turkey withdraw from the territories under its control in northwest Syria. Besides moves towards a potential rapprochement, Erdogan’s government has pushed on with its plan for refugees to “resettle voluntarily” in areas in Syria under Turkish security control. According to Turkey’s interior ministry, nearly 58,000 Syrians returned to their home country from November 2021 to October last year."

The arrest on Friday came amid condemnations from US and Turkish officials. Turkish news outlets had previously reported that Akbiyik is a Turkish citizen who left Turkey a year ago. Footage shared by the Turkish state-run news outlet Anadolu Agency showed a man dressed in black and sporting a hat bashing the glass façade of the building with a crowbar early on Monday. The facility, a skyscraper close to the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan, is known as the Turkish House. It houses the Turkish consulate in the city and its mission to the UN. The attack came nearly a week before Turkey’s presidential election run-off between Erdogan and opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Turkish ex-pats in New York voted in the elections at the Turkish House this week. The vote in Turkey will take place on Sunday. In response to the attack, New York Mayor Eric Adams visited the Turkish House on Monday and met Turkish diplomats in the city.

My thoughts are with my colleagues working relentlessly abroad for Turkiye, including this election period,” he wrote in a tweet earlier this week, using the Turkish government’s official spelling of Turkey. Jeff Flake, the US ambassador to Turkey, denounced the attack as well. The US and Turkey are NATO allies, but in recent years, there has been friction between the two countries, including over Washington’s support for Kurdish groups in Syria. Amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, Turkey helped broker a deal to continue the export of Ukrainian grains, and US officials have regularly emphasised the importance of its alliance with Turkey."

Berk Esen, assistant professor of political science at Istanbul’s Sabanci University, said opposition demoralisation was to be expected. “I think we will see him starting another five years on the anniversary of 1453,” said Osman Cakir, a 22-year-old student from Istanbul, referring to Monday’s anniversary of the Ottoman conquest of the city. In front of the Kadikoy bus and ferry terminal on Istanbul’s Asian shore, only Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party and Kilicdaroglu’s Republican People’s Party have a presence as well as a small tent for the Kilicdaroglu-supporting Deva Party. Erdogan on Friday was due to attend a women’s meeting and a small rally in Istanbul before a television interview in the evening. Two weeks earlier, his Friday schedule consisted of holding three rallies across Istanbul, hosting a youth summit and making a TV appearance. The overseas turnout in the first round, however, was much lower, at 54 percent, than the participation within Turkey."

Istanbul, Turkey – Istanbul’s skyline has been rapidly transforming over the years as towering new skyscrapers pop up and expansive bridges connect the metropolis that spans two continents. Since 2019, Grand Camlica Mosque – which stretches over 57,500sq metres (620,000sq feet) and has six minarets and a towering central dome – has been the most visible structure on the Anatolian side of Turkey’s cultural capital. Perched on the hill after which it is named, the now-largest mosque in Turkey opened its doors to the public on March 7, 2019, as a place of worship as well as a symbol of state pride and Turkish national identity. Since the establishment of the modern republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, Turkish nationalism has been largely defined by secular symbols that lean away from religion and the country’s Ottoman past. As president of the early republic, Ataturk outlawed the fez and turban – two forms of Ottoman male headgear – and later the headscarf was banned in state institutions. He also transformed the Turkish language from Arabic to Latin script, moved the capital city from the Ottoman epicentre of Constantinople – later known as Istanbul – to a newly established Ankara, and replaced religious courts with a European-inspired legal system. Although the “headscarf ban” was notably overturned by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which came to power 20 years ago, religious symbols have remained distinct from the secular Turkish state. Yet, Camlica Mosque reflects how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attempted to challenge the secular narrative of Turkish nationalism by attempting to connect state pride to an Ottoman past and an Islamic heritage. “The main objective of the 1923 Turkish revolution was to create a new nation and national identity by fighting the old one,” said Turkish sociologist Ferhat Kentel. Hayriye Gul, one of the two female architects behind the design of the complex, told Al Jazeera that the structure aimed to contribute to the silhouette of Istanbul in a modern and practical way while reflecting traditional Turco-Islamic architecture. “As Turkish citizens and architects, we’re proud to be part of building such a monumental mosque during the republican era,” said Mizrak."

The Turkish diaspora has begun voting in Turkey’s presidential run-off between incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who is seeking to end Erdogan’s two-decade rule. Some 3.4 million Turks abroad are eligible to vote, or about 5 percent of total votes. The diaspora vote had a clear impact on the outcome of the first round of the presidential election, with each politician retaining his strongholds in Europe where more than five million people of Turkish descent live. Newer communities of Turkish immigrants in Poland and Estonia voted overwhelmingly in favour of the opposition at 85 and 91 percent, respectively. The Turkish government asked to set up 26 polling stations at consulates and other locations around Germany, hoping to make voting more convenient for Turkish citizens here; Germany approved 16 of them. Serap Guler, a German MP of Turkish descent, said the close election result represented a failure for Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party). Speaking to Euronews last week, vote observer Onur Can Varoglu said: “Turkish politics is like football, you are born with your team and will support it no matter what.” If you are from a nationalist, Islamist background or a more pro-European immigrant one, you bring these values with you,” he said, suggesting family values were ultimately behind how Turks voted."

In one video, a victim from Elbistan in Kahramanmaras province, the earthquakes’ epicentre, said he is returning the free fertilizer he received from the CHP-run Ankara Metropolitan Municipality. Another victim shared with Murat Kurum, minister of environment and urbanisation, that during the earthquake he had taken a free bottle of water from an Ankara Metropolitan Municipality stand."

Now in his 20th year in power in Turkey, the president must have thought the recent elections had come around at the worst possible time, given the economic crisis, not one but two devastating earthquakes, frustration among the young, less-than-friendly relations with the West and a real desire for change on the part of millions of his fellow Turks. While the race isn’t over – there will now be a presidential run-off between Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu on May 28 – the Turkish opposition has to be demoralised, and will have to recalibrate, fast. Kilicdaroglu had been marketed as the soft-spoken dede (Turkish for grandfather), a deliberate tactic to differentiate him from the tough-talking Erdogan. He was a liberal who would roll back what the opposition view as Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian turn, healing relationships both inside and outside Turkey. What’s more, Kilicdaroglu’s approach is further evidence of what I view as the main takeaway from the elections: the undeniable rise and staying power of nationalism in Turkey, and, as I explain in this analysis piece, the reality that Erdogan’s eventual replacement is most likely going to be a nationalist.

The economist and longtime bureaucrat warned that the number of migrants in Turkey, which has a population of 85 million, could rise to 30 million while providing no evidence for the figures he cited. Kilicdaroglu went further on Thursday, saying that Erdogan “did not protect [Turkey’s] borders and honour”. Syrians began fleeing to Turkey and other nations starting in 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad crushed an uprising against his rule and caused war to break out. Turkey has taken in more Syrian refugees than any other country. Turks in general welcomed the refugees initially, but the country is now experiencing an economic crisis as the value of the lira has plunged and inflation has surged, causing resentment to grow against Syrians and other refugee and migrant populations. Nationalists have seized on the economic crisis and Turkey’s relatively welcoming policy towards refugees to attack the government. Turkish authorities have caught nearly 50,600 undocumented immigrants this year as of May 11 after apprehending 285,000 in 2022, according to Ministry of Interior data. Migrants and refugees living in Turkey have faced an increasingly hostile climate in recent years, which has led to growing support for their departure from the country and even violence. “We will not make Turkey a refugee warehouse, but the Syrians are our brothers and sisters."

On Wednesday, Muharrem Erkek, CHP’s deputy chair, said irregularities were found by the party in 7,094 ballot boxes after it checked more than 201,000 from within Turkey and abroad. Complaints over election irregularities are a common event during Turkish elections, and observers have pointed out that many of the discrepancies during Sunday’s vote may have been the result of errors in the CHP’s own system, rather than the YSK’s. Turkey’s presidential election will head to a run-off on May 28 after neither the incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan, nor CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu managed to win an outright 50 percent majority on Sunday. Speaking to journalists in Ankara on Wednesday, Erkek said extra votes were also given to Erdogan, without giving any evidence. That led to people posting discrepancies on social media, including instances in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast where HDP/YSP votes seemed to have been transferred to the MHP. Although election campaigns in Turkey have been criticised for allowing the governing party an unfair advantage over its use of state resources, control of media and legal intimidation of opponents, the actual vote itself had been thought to be largely secure. Roman Udot, co-chair of Golos, a Russian election data monitoring watchdog now based in Lithuania, said a study of YSK’s data of previous Turkish elections revealed “very strange things”. “We found 3,500 polling stations where the turnout was more than 100 percent, over 800 percent in one case, which is mathematically impossible,” he told a news conference in Istanbul on Wednesday. He added that data from the 2018 polls showed the number of registered voters in Ankara being 3 percent lower for the presidential race than the parliamentary vote. On Tuesday night, a group of people holding a “democracy watch” outside the YSK’s Ankara offices were detained by police."

Turkey summoned the German ambassador in Ankara on Wednesday to condemn the operation that targeted journalists from a pro-government Turkish newspaper in the latest case of tensions between the two NATO allies. Germany is home to the world’s largest Turkish diaspora community, but relations between Berlin and Ankara have suffered in recent years over many issues, including Germany’s handling of the followers of the United States-based Muslim leader Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a 2016 failed coup. Turkey has been enraged over Germany’s refusal to extradite military officers whom Ankara accuses of participating in the coup attempt after they claimed asylum. Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu news agency reported that German police had raided the Frankfurt office of the Turkish daily Sabah before detaining the journalists. Turkey’s foreign ministry denounced the “harassment and intimidation” of the reporters, who work for the pro-government Sabah. It said that what it described as the “arrests” of the journalists were “a deliberate act”, coming days after the first round of Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s media director, Fahrettin Altun, condemned the reported raids and the confiscation of the reporters’ equipment. He enters a May 28 run-off as the favourite against opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who has promised to broaden Turkey’s media freedoms.

The YSP, which is the third-largest party in the new parliament after Erdogan’s AK Party and Kilicdaroglu’s CHP, has denied ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state since 1984. In Wednesday’s video, Kilicdaroglu also accused Erdogan of cooperating with the Gulenist network that Ankara has accused of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. The network is classed in Turkey as a “terrorist organisation”."

Several Turkish officials lambasted the publication for its cover as Erdogan prepared to compete in a run-off at the end of the month to extend his 20 years in power. “Publications like Charlie Hebdo, whose only motivation is to spew hate against Islam, continue to target our President Erdogan clearly because he is one of the most consequential Muslim leaders in modern times,” Turkish Communications Director Fahrettin Altun said in a lengthy tweet. Translation: “I strongly condemn Charlie Hebdo’s targeting of our President and the will of the Turkish nation under the guise of freedom of expression.

But looking at Turkish politics today, there is one ideology that is represented across the board: nationalism. Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate. It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year. Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right. Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s. Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence. While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right. But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean. It all means that while Erdogan’s roots in political Islam can never be discounted and continue to be attractive to domestic conservatives, Turkish nationalism is arguably the stronger ideology within the Turkish government and will continue to be going forward."

In the eyes of Turkish nationalists, both Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu have the support of those they consider aligned with terror groups. Kilicdaroglu’s candidacy was backed by the Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), which stems from Turkey’s wider Kurdish movement and is considered a political bedfellow of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) by nationalists such as Ogan. The PKK has waged a 39-year campaign against the Turkish state, which has led to tens of thousands of deaths. It is listed as a terror organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Huda-Par has historic links to Hezbollah, a Kurdish group that waged a brutal campaign of violence in the 1990s as it fought the PKK and targeted Turkish police officers. Berk Esen, a political scientist at Istanbul’s Sabanci University, said splits between Kilicdaroglu and the nationalist Iyi Party, the second-largest party in his opposition Nation Alliance, turned nationalist voters away from his candidacy. “Many of them are Turkish nationalist voters who are not really sold by messages from either side because Erdogan is allied with Huda-Par, a Kurdish Islamist party, and Kilicdaroglu was seen as having a too cosy relationship with the Kurdish [HDP] opposition,” Esen said. He served a term as an MHP parliamentary deputy from 2011 to 2015 for his home province Igdir, which lies on Turkey’s eastern border."

Turkey’s high-stakes presidential election is headed for a run-off vote, Turkey’s electoral chief Ahmet Yener, has said, citing official results from the country’s Supreme Election Council. As neither secured more than 50 percent of the vote, they will face off in a second round on May 28, taking Turkey into uncharted territory. This is only the third time that Turks directly voted for a president, with Erdogan winning both previous elections outright in the first round. The Turkish news agency published preliminary results that showed AK Party won 266 seats, while the main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP) won 166 seats in the 600-seat parliament. The 2023 elections also took on extra significance merely due to the date – the year marks the centenary of the Republic of Turkey. The country’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk also established the Republican People’s Party (CHP), which governed under a largely one-party system for 27 years. Turkey’s elections had been billed as the most consequential since its first fair multi-party polls in 1950 – boiling down to a choice between five more years of Erdogan, Turkey’s most electorally successful politician, or a new direction under an old party that has reinvented itself in recent years. During a wearying campaign, Erdogan frequently spoke at multiple rallies in a day, highlighting the advances made in Turkey during his 20-year rule while simultaneously lambasting the opposition for supporting “terrorism” or being in thrall to the West. Kilicdaroglu, who has set the CHP on a more social democratic path since taking the helm of the party in 2010, was able to call on the support of alliance partners and the nationally recognised CHP mayors of Ankara and Istanbul to share the burden of public appearances. Both candidates made use of social media to get their messages across in a vote where nearly five million were casting their ballots for the first time, with Kilicdaroglu employing Twitter videos filmed at his home in Ankara."

After a highly-contested first round of elections on Sunday, Turkey is very likely heading towards a run-off vote on May 28 as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was hoping to secure a third term, has barely failed to secure the required 50 percent of votes, despite faring better than predicted. He and his closest competitor, Kemal Kilicdarolgu, will likely gear up to campaign over the next two weeks as Erdogan tries to extend his two-decade rule, and Kilicdaroglu hopes to launch Turkey on a “new path” with the backing of his six-party alliance. The final results from Sunday’s vote are expected to be announced by 3pm (12:00 GMT) on Monday, Al Jazeera’s Farah al-Zaman Shawki said from Ankara, with votes from abroad yet to be fully counted. With 99 percent of domestic ballot boxes counted, Erdogan had 49.92 percent of votes, with Kilicdaroglu trailing closely with 44.95 percent of votes, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency, which gets its numbers from Turkey’s Supreme Election Council. This would be the first run-off vote under Turkey’s new electoral system. Turkey transitioned from a parliamentary system to a presidential one in July 2018. The 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2007 presidential elections went to a third round, but both the voting and political systems were different from the ones in place in Turkey now. In a tweet on Monday, however, Ogan contested saying anything to Der Spiegel that differed from what he had told the Turkish press. Translation: No, Der Spiegel, in the interview I gave you, we didn’t say anything different from the general conditions we said to the Turkish press. Carkoglu said what went wrong for the opposition was that “they couldn’t get any support from the heartland of Turkey”. “They are also questioning the alliance with the pro-Kurdish HDP which the Turkish government considers to be a political wing of the PKK,” she said."

In the aftermath of Turkey’s dramatic elections, a new name is on the lips of political commentators: third-placed presidential contender Sinan Ogan. Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu and Ankara mayor Mansur Yavaş have cried foul over the way the state-run Anadolu news agency reported electoral results on Sunday, saying it had given an exaggerated portrayal of Erdogan’s lead. The news agency is widely used by international outlets for the coverage of Turkey. Turkey’s High Election Board (YSK) showed a lack of transparency in its handling of Sunday’s elections, according to observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). “I regret to note that the election administration’s work was lacking in transparency,” Ambassador Jan Petersen, head of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights election observation mission, said at the press conference in Ankara, Turkey. Erdogan and Kilicdaroglu both bagged 48 percent of the votes in Turkey’s Hatay province, the latter edging out the incumbent by a few percentage points. The Istanbul prosecutor’s office has launched an investigation into the social media accounts behind posts spreading false information about the election results, state media said."

Earlier, two senior figures from the CHP – Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and his Ankara counterpart Mansur Yavas – heavily criticised Anadolu’s role in the election. Turkey’s opposition has accused Anadolu of manipulating the timing of its results in past elections, claiming that it always shows an early lead for the AK Party and delays voting figures for areas where the opposition is strong."

Turks have finished voting in one of the most consequential elections in the country’s 100-year history, a contest that could end President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s 20-year rule and reverberate well beyond Turkey’s borders. A heavy turnout means that there have been long lines at polling stations across Turkey, particularly in its biggest cities. The Istanbul Bar Association has reminded people that if they are already waiting at a polling station before 5pm they will be able to stay and vote, but anyone joining the queue after will not be allowed to vote. Turkish law bans the reporting of any results until 9pm (18:00 GMT), although that has been brought forward in the past. The presidential vote will decide not only who leads Turkey, a NATO-member country of 85 million, but also how it is governed, where its economy is headed amid a deep cost-of-living crisis, and the shape of its foreign policy. Turkey has grown into a military and geopolitical heavyweight that plays roles in conflicts from Syria to Ukraine. So Turkey may enter a post-Erdogan era after Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, and that could mean foreign policy changes. Erdogan is still lionised across swathes of Turkey that witnessed a development boom during his rule. The emergence of Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his six-party alliance – a group that forms the type of broad-based coalition that Erdogan excelled at forging throughout his career – gives foreign allies and Turkish voters a clear alternative. But he would still be hounded by Turkey’s most dire economic crisis of his time in power and disquiet over his government’s stuttering response to February earthquakes that claimed more than 50,000 lives."

Istanbul, Turkey – As his country stands on the verge of its centenary, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has framed the next 100 years as the “Century of Turkey”. The presidential and parliamentary elections are billed by many as the most important since Turkey held its first fair multi-party vote in 1950, also on May 14. Each of Turkey’s 81 provinces counts as an electoral constituency apart from Izmir, Bursa, Istanbul and Ankara, which are split into two or three voting regions. Some 1.8 million Turkish citizens living abroad have already cast their ballots in 73 countries or at border gates. The pro-Kurdish Halkların Demokratik Party (People’s Democratic Party, HDP), which is fielding candidates under the banner of the Yeşil Sol Party (Green Left Party, YSP) due to a court case that threatens its closure, is the main party in the Labour and Freedom Alliance with the Türkiye İşçi Party (Turkey Workers’ Party, TIP) and several smaller left-wing groups. The United Nations estimated some three million left the disaster area in the weeks after the quakes struck, mostly for other parts of Turkey. “There are many unknowns that will only become apparent on election day,” said Berk Esen, assistant professor in political science at Istanbul’s Sabanci University."

Turkey’s two main presidential candidates made their final appearances in public during the last hours of campaigning on the eve of presidential and parliamentary elections that could significantly shape the NATO member’s future. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his last election rallies in Istanbul on Saturday, before a so-called propaganda ban went into effect, accusing the opposition of working with US President Joe Biden to topple him while making a final appeal in the run-up to the biggest challenge to his 20-year rule. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said that Erdogan spent the last two days of his campaign in Istanbul. First constructed as a cathedral in the Christian Byzantine Empire, then converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, and later a museum in 1935 in the early days of the modern secular Turkish state, the iconic monument was reconverted into a mosque in 2020, under Erdogan. Kilicdaroglu did not hold a rally on Saturday, instead paying his respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, in Ankara. On Friday, he asked tens of thousands gathered to hear his final speech to vote on Sunday to “change Turkey’s destiny”. Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Ankara, said that Kilicdaroglu remained confident and determined: “He says it will be a historic moment for the people of Turkey.” Ahelbarra said the visit to the mausoleum of Ataturk, also the founder of the Cumhuriyet Halk Party (Republican People’s Party, CHP), on the last day of campaigning was important because “Kilicdaroglu has kept saying during the campaign that he is fighting for the secular identity of Turkey.” At a rally in Istanbul, Erdogan also recalled comments made by Biden, and published by the New York Times in January 2020, when he was campaigning for the White House."

Why the Turkish elections are a big test for Erdoğan | Start Here This weekend, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the man who has dominated Turkish politics for two decades, is seeking to extend his rule for another five years. Erdogan comes from a conservative political tradition and has developed a reputation as a divisive figure in a country that was founded along secularist lines in the 1920s by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. He surpassed Ataturk’s 15 years in Turkey’s top post five years ago, becoming the longest serving leader the country has known. The election will be held as Turkey is experiencing a series of economic crises that have led to rampant inflation and a deepening cost-of-living crunch. February’s earthquakes in southeastern Turkey heaped further pressure on Erdogan with many people criticising his government’s response and failure to enforce building regulations, claiming these factors contributed to the loss of more than 50,000 lives. The president, however, has many supporters who point to his successes over the years and see him as the man to tackle Turkey’s current troubles. “Of course, over 20 years, there are going to be bad periods as well as good,” said Ahmet Gokkaya, a shopkeeper in Istanbul’s conservative Fatih district. Does he control every building site in Turkey? Erdogan’s political career can be traced back to the 1970s in Beyoglu, the Istanbul district that includes his childhood home in Kasimpasa, a working class neighbourhood on the slopes leading from the glitzy shops of Istiklal Avenue to the waters of the Golden Horn. He rose through the ranks, in 1994 becoming mayor of Istanbul, where he addressed many of the problems facing the city’s rapidly growing population, such as air pollution, rubbish collection and a lack of clean water. Most commentators see the first decade of AK Party rule as one in which the government embraced democratic reforms as Turkey sought to join the European Union."

Who is Turkey’s opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu? Some opposition supporters even feared his presidential candidacy would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as Erdogan has struggled with an economic crisis and the aftermath of February’s deadly earthquakes in southeastern Turkey. Ahead of the first round, Kilicdaroglu has centred his campaign on a promise to return Turkey to parliamentary democracy – ending the presidential system introduced by Erdogan that critics deride as “one-man rule”. Born in Tunceli province, eastern Turkey, Kilicdaroglu carved out a career as a government accountant, rising steadily for 20 years to become head of Turkey’s social insurance institute. Failing to make the party’s list for the 1999 election, he switched to the CHP and entered parliament three years later as a deputy for Istanbul, earning a reputation for exposing corruption. Despite an unsuccessful bid for mayor of Istanbul in 2009, the following year, Kilicdaroglu received overwhelming support for his party leadership bid after the incumbent was engulfed in a sex tape scandal. During his 13-year tenure at the head of Turkey’s oldest political party, established by the country’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Kilicdaroglu has moved the CHP away from its Kemalist roots towards becoming a social democratic movement able to reach out to conservative voters that form Erdogan’s base. Allied with the right-wing Iyi Party (Good Party) and the ultra-conservative Saadet Party (Felicity Party), and backed by Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish party, the Halkların Demokratik Party (Peoples’ Democratic Party, HDP), the CHP won a number of major cities from the AK Party, including Istanbul and Ankara. The first obvious sign of Kilicdaroglu shaking off his bureaucrat image had come two years earlier when, aged 68, he carried out a 450km (280-mile) “March for Justice” from Ankara to Istanbul. During the campaign, Kilicdaroglu has played on his more homely image to reach out through social media, particularly to Turkey’s 4.9 million first-time voters."

Ahead of Turkey’s presidential and parliamentary elections on May 14, he has been training volunteers to work as election observers at polling stations across the region of Hatay. The elections, in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces the biggest challenge to his two decades in power, are taking place three months after earthquakes destroyed parts of southern Turkey and northwestern Syria. Nearly 51,000 people died in Turkey alone. Turkey’s High Election Board (YSK) said earlier this year that only 133,000 people from the earthquake region have re-registered to vote elsewhere. “The election could have been delayed, or the city could have been given special status,” Karatas said, reflecting a feeling voiced by many displaced voters across Turkey, who think they should have been able to vote for their local parliament member in Hatay without having to face the logistical challenges of travelling back. The opposition has said it aimed to reverse the president’s unorthodox economic policies, largely blamed for the freefall of the Turkish lira against the dollar and runaway inflation. It also pledged to do away with the presidential system introduced after a referendum in 2017 and restore Turkey to a parliamentary democracy. He returned from Ankara a week back for the elections. “I think I will go to Eskisehir [a city in northwest Turkey], for one or two years,” he said, “I’ll do anything, any job. As half of the citizens of Turkey look at the coming days with hope for a turning point in their country’s history, residents of Antakya look at their devastated city and wonder how long it will take before it is rebuilt."

Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who is challenging Turkey’s longtime leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sunday’s presidential ballot, said “foreign hackers” recruited by his rival are preparing deepfakes – manipulated videos and soundbites – aimed at discrediting the opposition days before the election. “If you want our friendship after May 15, get your hands off the Turkish state,” the main opposition alliance’s candidate added in tweets written in Turkish and Russian. In response to Kilicdaroglu’s claims, Kremlin on Friday denied it was meddling in Turkey’s presidential election campaign. He added that Moscow “highly values” its bilateral relations with Ankara. “Turkey has a very responsible, sovereign and thought-through position on a whole range of regional and global problems that we face,” Peskov said.

In August 2019, after inspecting the cockpit of Russia’s then-new fifth-generation Su-57 fighter warplane, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, if it was for sale. The exchange exemplified the renewed closeness of Turkish-Russian security relations after a difficult period, during which Turkey downed a Russian fighter plane that it said had strayed across the border from Syria. As Turkey has sought to position itself as a regional heavyweight, the Justice and Development Party or AK Party leader’s confident, if confrontational, style has shaped the country’s international relations. Turkey has certainly grown more influential – not just across the Middle East, but also Africa and Europe, with its prominent role in mediating between Russia and Ukraine a particular example. So, Turkey may enter a post-Erdogan era after Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, and that could mean foreign policy changes. “The style of foreign policymaking will change and that’s more important than issue-based changes because currently foreign policy is conducted entirely [in] a personalised manner,” Salim Cevik, a researcher at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik’s Center for Applied Turkey Studies in Berlin, Germany, told Al Jazeera. “Turkey will be much more predictable because it will be more institutionalised,” the researcher said. Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East, said that Erdogan’s policies are also aimed at increasing Turkey’s soft power, particularly in the Muslim world, a continuation of the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled vast swaths of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans for centuries. “Erdogan’s assertive nature has irked the major powers who are more accustomed to Turkey’s historical role as a supporting actor,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera. “At the same time, Turkey’s rapidly expanding influence is rooted in Erdogan’s ability to capitalise on Islamic soft power via his ‘Muslim’ rhetoric, enabling him to advance rapidly both politically and economically into [multiple regions],” he added."

Incidents of stone-throwing, physical attacks on election workers and gunmen shooting up party offices have all been recorded in recent weeks as Turkey heads towards knife-edge polls in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to extend his 20-year rule. In Turkey’s highly polarised political landscape, however, claims and counter-claims blur the facts surrounding incidents. Savci Sayan, a parliamentary candidate for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in Izmir, western Turkey, said his campaign bus was attacked by opposition supporters on Monday night. Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, who has been named as one of several vice presidents if the opposition wins, was pelted with stones from behind the bus. Fears of political violence are very real in Turkey, where many remember the late 1970s when thousands were killed by political gangs. The bloodletting was stemmed after a military coup in 1980 but re-emerged when the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) launched its armed campaign against the Turkish state in 1984. Ahead of elections in June 2015, a bombing of a rally of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, caused at least four deaths and hundreds of injuries. Three years ago, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, now the main opposition candidate against Erdogan, was attacked by a mob while attending the funeral of a soldier in Ankara province. Erdogan also came close to being killed in a 2016 coup attempt that caused more than 280 deaths when rogue commandos stormed his holiday hotel in southwest Turkey. During this campaign, violence has also broken out at polling stations outside Turkey. Some 1.8 million Turks living overseas cast their ballots in the two weeks leading to Tuesday."

Istanbul, Turkey – For Turkish women wearing the hijab, or Muslim headscarf, life in the public sphere was once impossible. In a sign of just how much Turkey has changed, Erdogan and the AK Party’s main rival in Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), has cast aside its staunchly secular stance and reversed its longstanding opposition to the hijab in recent years, and assured women that their right to wear a headscarf would be protected. People are more educated and aware of their rights,” Esin, a beauty salon worker who wears the hijab told Al Jazeera while taking a stroll with her friend in Istanbul’s Karakoy district. Fatma, an academic, left Turkey for the United States having felt frozen out of Turkish academia over her choice to wear the headscarf. Many conservative Turks give Erdogan credit for freeing religious restrictions. I don’t feel I will have the same freedom if the CHP gets elected,” Aisha, a 23-year-old student wearing a headscarf, told Al Jazeera while walking with three female friends in Istanbul’s city centre. Earlier in October, the CHP leader announced that he would submit a draft law to protect the freedom to wear a headscarf in public institutions in a bid to appeal to conservative Turks, among whom the secularist party has traditionally had little support. According to Berk Esen, a political scientist whose research interests include Turkish politics and democratic backsliding, the CHP’s switch is to be partly attributed to the structural change in the country’s politics since the AK Party’s rise to power, but also to the CHP’s approach to secularism that has turned more “moderate” on a number of conservative talking points. The CHP’s overtures reflect Turkey’s transformation in the past couple of decades in terms of the acceptance of religiously conservative people in public life, which can be explained by the “hybridisation” of Turkish society, as Esen called it."

Turkey’s voters head to the polls on Sunday in an election that will not only determine the country’s domestic policies but could also influence Sweden’s NATO membership. While most NATO members were quick to ratify the two Nordic nations’ membership applications, Turkey and Hungary held back. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both countries, especially Sweden, of providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorists”. Erdogan also called on Finland and Sweden to lift an arms embargo on Turkey they had imposed in 2019 after Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria. He said these were important “security concerns” for Turkey that had to be resolved before he agreed to NATO’s enlargement. The three nations signed an agreement on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Madrid last year, in which Finland and Sweden pledged to address Turkey’s security demands. But Turkey has only ratified Finland’s NATO membership. After a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin in March, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told reporters that he hoped Turkey would ratify Sweden’s NATO membership after the elections. “With Turkey, we have signed a memorandum where we were required to address some demands, which Stockholm has done everything it can to address,” he told Al Jazeera. “But currently, nothing in terms of any ratification is happening until we have clarity on who’s going to govern Turkey for the next few years,” he said. Bildt added that Turkey’s decision will also influence Hungary. Budapest followed Ankara’s lead in the case of Finland. Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute’s Turkey Programme and author of Erdogan’s War: A Strongman’s Struggle at Home and in Syria, told Al Jazeera that part of the reason the Turkish leader has dragged his feet on Sweden is for domestic gains. “His role in getting both Finland and Sweden to lift sanctions they had imposed on Turkey after its incursion into Syria and getting especially Sweden to try and extradite PKK members has appealed to nationalist voters,” she said."

One survey for the Ankara Institute suggests while 90 percent of government supporters rate the government’s response to the earthquake as successful, 90 percent of opposition supporters say it failed. They promise to restore Turkey to a parliamentary democracy and reverse Erdogan’s unorthodox economic policies based on interest rate cuts – which many economists blame for the country’s skyrocketing inflation and the Turkish currency’s loss of more than 70 percent of its value in the last two years. More than 200,000 buildings were either destroyed or severely damaged in the earthquakes, and the estimated cost for Turkey could run upwards of $100bn, according to United Nations estimates. As Turkish citizens are called to cast two different votes on May 14 – one to elect the president and another for a local member of parliament – he says he is hopeful some voters in the province may split their vote and opt for Erdogan as president, but give their parliament seat to the opposition."

Turks are getting ready to vote in critical presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday, as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s public support is put to the test against the backdrop of a severe economic crisis. The economy has topped the election agenda for many Turks, with a cost-of-living crisis fueled by soaring inflation. Other issues widely discussed in the campaign period have been what the governance system of the country should be, the fate of the millions of Syrians residing in Turkey and recovery policies to heal the country’s wounds from the twin February earthquakes that killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes. There are three alliances that are expected to make it to parliament amid a significantly high seven percent election threshold in Turkey’s recently amended electoral system. The alliance’s campaign, led by the president, argues that it can fix the problems of Turkey once again, as it did in the past. “The alliance uses a very sharp ‘fight against terror’ rhetoric to appeal to nationalist sentiments in the country as it promises to keep Turkey strong, independent and respected in foreign policy,” he said. “These topics are likely to be the new battleground of identity politics in Turkey.” Dalay said that the Nation Alliance uses a rhetoric of “change” in almost all policy areas to attract people who are not happy with the current situation in Turkey. “They promise to make changes in almost all policy areas and change the political system Turkey is governed with. The left-wing alliance is led by the third largest party in Turkey, the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), the members of which will race in the parliamentary elections under the banner of the Green Left Party because of an ongoing court case. The Workers’ Party of Turkey is the second-largest party in the alliance followed by smaller left-wing groups.

Muharrem Ince of the Homeland Party announced on Thursday that he was standing down from the presidential election, just three days before polls that have been billed as the most important in recent Turkish history. “Turkey could not protect my reputation. “The Homeland Party is important for Turkey’s future. We welcome Mr Ince to Turkey’s table. KONDA, one of Turkey’s more respected polling firms, questioned 3,480 people in 35 of Turkey’s 81 provinces. Addressing a rally in Ankara, Erdogan also remarked on Ince’s withdrawal. “Polls put his support at a few points, which might have pushed the vote to a runoff,” said Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute’s Center for Turkish Studies in Washington, DC. Timothy Ash, a London-based economist specialising in Turkey, described the development as “another crazy day in Turkish politics”. He cancelled rallies in western Turkey on Wednesday, citing health reasons. “Such a slander has never been seen in the history of the republic,” he said in a brief news conference outside his party headquarters in Ankara."

Istanbul, Turkey – Standing tentatively on the fringes of a protest in Istanbul, Asmin Y says she has no choice but to vote for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s main challenger, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, because her desired candidate is not on the ballot and has been behind bars since 2016. So as not to split the opposition vote, Demirtas, who faces various “terror charges”, is not among the four presidential contenders for the May 14 elections that are taking place in the centenary year of the Turkish republic. The government accuses the HDP – the second-largest opposition party – of having ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), designated a “terrorist” group by Turkey and its Western allies. The PKK has fought a war against the Turkish state since 1984, which has killed nearly 40,000 people, the majority civilians. Kurds form a significant minority in Turkey, although there is no official data on their numbers. “We need change, people to change, Turkey to change,” said Mahir Ulunur, a 41-year-old plumber with Kurdish roots from eastern Malatya, who lives in Istanbul. “We need a revolution, people like Erkan Bas [leader of the left-wing Workers’ Party of Turkey, TIP],” he said, adding that his vote for president will go to Kilicdaroglu, and for parliament to the TIP, which is part of the Freedom and Labour Alliance that includes the Green Left. Firat Akbulut, a 60-year-old Kurd living in Istanbul, believes only Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) will extricate the country from its current, entrenched economic morass and safeguard national security. This problem is all over the world, not only in Turkey. It is a bad time, but we are more secure with him,” said Akbulut, who works as a dry cleaner in Esenyurt district, as he criticised Istanbul’s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who would become one of two vice presidents if the CHP alliance wins, for a planned eight-hour power cut."

Syria’s Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad was quoted as saying by the Syrian state news agency SANA that “despite all the negatives of the past years, there is an opportunity” for Damascus and Ankara to work together. But the priority for the Syrian government was ending the presence of all foreign militaries, including Turkey’s. Syria’s northwest includes territory held by opposition groups, including armed forces backed by Turkey. Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement that there had been a “positive and constructive atmosphere” and that the countries’ deputy foreign ministers would be tasked with preparing a roadmap to advance Syria-Turkey ties. In his opening speech, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed hope that the meeting would pave the way to drafting a road map for normalising Turkey-Syria relations. Moscow is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s main ally and Russia has encouraged reconciliation with Turkey. Syrian and Turkish defence ministers also held talks in Moscow in December. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stressed the need for “cooperation in the fight against terrorism and working together to establish the basis for the return of Syrians” during the meeting, he said in a tweet. NATO member Turkey has backed political and armed opposition to al-Assad during the 12-year war, and sent its troops into the country’s north. The restoration of ties with Damascus quickened pace following the deadly February 6 earthquake in Turkey and Syria, and the Chinese-brokered re-establishment of ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which had backed opposing sides in the Syrian conflict."

Athens, Greece – So-called earthquake diplomacy is a potential opportunity for Ankara and Athens to mend fences after elections in both countries this month. That seems to be the prevailing theory in the US State Department, after earthquakes in February killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and left 1.5 million homeless. Greece was the first country to send emergency assistance and extraction teams to Turkey, and the foreign and defence ministers of both countries have since met and proclaimed improved relations. After expressing his condolences for a rail disaster in late February that killed 57 people in Greece, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan restated Ankara’s disputes about Greek sovereignty over the east Aegean islands. Last year, Erdogan’s junior coalition partner caused a stir when he published a map depicting some islands as Turkish. His defence minister, Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos, said their publication was a sign of the fact that “long-term Turkish goals don’t change”. Nonetheless, there is a persistent rumour that after Turkey’s May 14 elections and Greece’s May 21 vote, the US will encourage Germany to undertake a diplomatic initiative to get Greek-Turkish talks going. In 2020, the Greek and Turkish navies nearly came to blows, as Greece objected to Turkish surveys for undersea oil and gas in what it considers its continental shelf. Turkey, not a signatory to UNCLOS, objects, and has threatened Greece with war should it extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical miles off its mainland and island coasts in the Aegean – another UNCLOS entitlement. And all roundly agree on the election result they would like to see in Turkey. “The second is that Erdogan is seen as an autocratic figure who is becoming worse, and Kilicdaroglu advertises that his Turkey will become more democratic … He will draw closer to the EU.” A Turkey that draws closer to the European Union is to Greece’s liking, says a senior Greek diplomat on condition of anonymity. “Turkey prefers in general to keep Greek-Turkish issues on a bilateral level … Why? Turkey is stronger than Greece, and in a bilateral context is the stronger party,” said the diplomat."
Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/news/2023/5/10/women-face-political-barriers-ahead-turkey-elections,Women face political barriers ahead of Turkey elections,10 May 2023,"Polling shows that most Turks want more women involved in politics, but their underrepresentation continues. Istanbul, Turkey – A nondescript apartment in Istanbul’s business district is the nerve centre of a drive to propel more women into Turkish politics. However, due to the nature of the election process – votes for parties are allocated to candidates according to their placement on ranked party lists – just four stand any real hope of entering the Turkish Grand National Assembly. The Workers’ Party of Turkey (TIP) is fielding the highest proportion of female candidates at 40.5 percent. The CHP has women ranked first on its list in just 11 of Turkey’s 87 electoral districts, while the AKP has four. The underrepresentation of women in national legislatures is not a situation unique to Turkey. Turkey comes 132nd in the world, with 17.4 percent of the deputies elected in 2018 being women. Some have pointed to patriarchal societies as the main barrier to women becoming involved in politics, but evidence in Turkey suggests such attitudes have eased significantly. In research carried out by Ben Secerim and the polling firm KONDA last year, 62 percent of respondents said that female politicians would help Turkey develop and become a better society. Turkish women have long been at the forefront of campaigning on social issues. Turkey’s 2021 withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention on protecting women against violence increased civil activists’ fears. A government statement at the time said: “The decision to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention in no way means that the State of the Republic of Türkiye ‘compromised to protect women’. Lawyer Sibel Piskin is standing for the opposition Iyi Party in Kirklareli, one of 20 Turkish provinces to have never had a woman in parliament. On the streets of Istanbul, women were equally forthright in their opinions of men’s political dominance and how to solve Turkey’s current economic woes."

Lives in: A 90-square-metre, three-bedroom flat in the district of Mamak on the outskirts of the Turkish capital, Ankara. The family owns their flat, which they bought for 66,000 Turkish lira in 2009, which was equivalent to roughly $42,150 at the time. She sits in the dining area of her Ankara flat, a lavish table of Turkish delicacies in front of her: dumplings, stuffed vine leaves, a variety of pastries, stuffed meatballs, strawberries and baklava. Born and raised in the village of Kayseri in Central Anatolia about 350km (220 miles) from Ankara, Latife married her uncle’s son when she was 15 and moved to the Turkish capital as a young bride. According to the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions, in March, the poverty line, the minimum cost for a family of four to cover food, housing, ultilities, transport, health and education, was 31,240 lira ($1,600) - a steep rise from 16,052 lira ($822) in March 2022. Latife feels fortunate that thanks to universal healthcare in Turkey, they have health insurance and these illnesses don’t result in high medical bills. Despite the challenges, Latife stresses that she is optimistic about the future and feels fortunate for the life she has, particularly compared with the hard days she spent as a 15-year-old bride in Ankara. Universal healthcare in Turkey has eased much of the family’s financial burden. At 71 percent, Turkey’s food inflation last year was the highest among the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which had a 15 percent average. The United States Department of Agriculture (PDF) reported that in May 2022, average food prices in Turkey were up 92 percent from the year before. As a skilled cook who always gets compliments on her food, she decided a few years ago to start an Instagram page to sell her homemade products such as mantı, a type of small dumpling typically filled with beef and a labour-intensive dish popular in Turkey. Roughly half of it went to the survivors of the earthquakes that devastated southeast Turkey and northern Syria on February 6."

Turkey’s elections on May 14 are attracting significant international attention, with major media outlets dubbing them “the most important elections of 2023”. Many in the West seem to hope the Turks will finally replace President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) with a more accommodating liberal leadership that will bring about a profound change in the country’s domestic and international policies. In the West, the Turkish president has been described as “the other Putin”, a populist, divisive autocrat determined to pursue his dream of empire. Predictably, such characterisations have been condemned by Turkey’s pro-Erdogan media and ridiculed as arrogant and fanciful. He has, therefore, used the levers of the state to his advantage, making big announcements on the eve of the elections about Turkey’s forthcoming fortunes. He will continue to pursue a hybrid approach towards major powers by balancing Turkish interests with the West and Russia. He will maintain Turkey’s membership in NATO while strengthening trade and geopolitical relations with Russia. Kilicdaroglu, on the other hand, may be inclined to reverse some of his predecessor’s domestic political and economic policies and undo some of the illiberal measures enacted since Turkey’s 2016 failed coup in favour of greater institutionalism. But judging by the historic record, leaders in Turkey and elsewhere tend to keep executive powers and privileges they inherit from their predecessors. If elected, he is likely to soften Turkey’s tone towards its Western and NATO partners and remove its veto on Sweden’s membership in the military alliance. But it is doubtful that he would sacrifice Ankara’s lucrative economic and energy relationship with Moscow – especially as bilateral trade reached $70bn last year – to satisfy the West. With former Erdogan ally and strategist Ahmet Davutoglu now on his side, Kilicdaroglu is likely to maintain Turkey’s active regional and international posture, which, despite some setbacks, has served the country’s economic and geopolitical interests."

Serhan Ulkucu and his wife had to bargain hard with their landlord before they could seal a deal to renew the annual lease for their family home in the Istanbul neighbourhood of Bostanci. The monthly rent for the family’s two-bedroom flat, where they live with their seven-year-old son, has increased by 147 percent in a year, from 4,650 Turkish liras to 11,500 liras (about $600) – 25 percent more than the minimum wage in Turkey. Turkey has been going through soaring inflation and an economic downturn that have hit the country particularly hard since last year, in the run-up to critical presidential and parliamentary elections set to test public support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on May 14. According to data from Turkey’s central bank, property prices across the country in February recorded (PDF) an annual increase of 141.5 percent in Turkish liras. The colossal increase in property prices is happening despite a continuing fall in property sales – in March the number of sales dropped 21.4 percent year-on-year, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute. The cost of renting a property across Turkey was also up in March, 157 percent year-on-year, a report by the Center for Economic and Social Research (BETAM) at Istanbul’s Bahcesehir University said. In advance of the upcoming polls, Erdogan has also sought to get more working- and middle-class Turks on the housing ladder. In the meantime, though, Turks are feeling the pinch. All three Turkish citizens who spoke to Al Jazeera said their purchasing power had fallen significantly since last year, with increases in their income not catching up with the hikes in expenses in the country, most strikingly the housing prices. Both Cikikcioglu and Cagan, a long-term Istanbul resident, said that buying a property is a “dream” for Turks who work on salaries."

Friday’s announcement pushes one of Turkey’s largest voting blocs behind opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the People’s Republican Party, and further complicates Erdogan’s path to achieving more than two decades in power. The Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), the third-largest in Turkey’s parliament, decided last month not to field a presidential candidate and strongly hinted that it would back Kilicdaroglu without officially endorsing his candidacy. “In this historic election, we call on the people of Turkey to vote for the Labour and Freedom Alliance in the parliamentary elections and for Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the presidential elections,” the HDP and its allies said in a statement. HDP co-leader Mithat Sancar called the upcoming vote “the most crucial in Turkey’s history”. The HDP has won more than 10 percent of the vote in past national elections and represents a community accounting for about a fifth of Turkey’s population. Erdogan lifted linguistic and cultural restrictions on the community and tried to end a bloody Kurdish struggle for an independent state in Turkey’s southeast through talks. Since then, Turkey has jailed thousands of activists and replaced dozens of elected HDP mayors with state trustees after accusing them of having ties with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). It has fought a war against the Turkish state since 1984 and is a designated “terrorist” group in Turkey, the European Union and the United States."

Authorities on Tuesday said the detained are suspected of financing the PKK in addition to recruiting members or engaging in propaganda on behalf of the group, which Turkey and several Western nations consider to be a “terrorist” outfit. The PKK has been at war with the Turkish state since 1984. Turkish media reported that Tuesday’s raids were conducted in 21 provinces, including in Diyarbakir in the southeast, which has a Kurdish majority. The raids were conducted weeks ahead of May 14 parliamentary and presidential elections, which pose the most serious challenge to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s two-decade rule over Turkey. The Media and Law Studies Association (MLSA), a Turkish non-profit, said NGO leaders were among those who had their homes searched early in the morning. Opinion polls give him a slight lead over the longtime Turkish leader. The Turkish government has accused the HDP of having ties to the PKK, and the former leader of the HDP, Selahattin Demirtas, has been imprisoned after being found guilty in various cases tied to threatening officials and insulting the president. Erdogan, who has been Turkey’s leader since 2003 and has occupied the presidency since 2014, still retains significant support and could yet emerge on top alongside his AK Party."

As she laid food on the carpet for last year’s Bayram – as Eid al-Fitr is known in Turkey – little did she know that it would be the last happy Ramadan her family would spend together. By then, the family’s finances had already been tested by the increasing inflation devastating Turkey’s economy and the rising cost of living. “I thought that was my life’s biggest challenge, that I’d never recover from such a huge pain,” she says quietly as she sits on the floor of her house, preparing gözleme – a typical flatbread from Turkey’s southeast filled with potatoes and herbs – for iftar. On February 6, at 4.17am, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake devastated vast swathes of southeastern Turkey, including Sevim’s village. “For now the Turkish government is not taking water and electricity money for six months after the tragedy,” Sevim says.

Polls show support sagging in recent years since the Turkish lira has fallen steeply in value and inflation has skyrocketed. Even so, the president repeated his economic mantra that investment, production, exports and an eventual current account surplus would drive up Turkey’s gross domestic product. “We will bring inflation back down to single digits and definitely save our country from this problem,” he told a crowd at an Ankara stadium on Tuesday. Erdogan sought aggressive interest rate cuts, which the Central Bank of Turkey carried out, sending inflation to a 24-year peak of more than 85 percent in October before it dipped to near 50 percent in March. The ensuing cost-of-living crisis has gripped Turkish households and squeezed earnings and savings, bottoming out people’s purchasing power. Support for Erdogan dipped slightly after February’s earthquakes, which killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, because many voters believed the initial response to the disaster was too slow, according to surveys. Ankara recently took steps to mend relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria after years of tension. Erdogan also said he aims to build an “axis of Turkey”. “We will build the axis of Turkey with a foreign policy where both our country, our region and humanity will find peace and stability, multilateralism, more cooperation, peace, stability and humanitarian diplomacy,” he said."

The Iraqi demand on Saturday came as a Turkish Defence Ministry official told the Reuters news agency that no Turkish Armed Forces operation had taken place in that region in recent days. It said Ankara had no legal justification to continue “intimidating civilians under the pretext that forces hostile to it are present on Iraqi soil”. “In this regard, we call on the Turkish government to take responsibility and present an official apology,” it said. Turkey, which has spent decades fighting Kurdish armed groups in its east, has conducted several military operations including air raids in northern Iraq and northern Syria against Kurdish-led forces there. Ankara views the Kurdish-led forces as “terrorists” allied with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK. Asked about the reason behind the attack, Abdi said, “It is a clear message from the Turks that they are bothered and oppose our international relations and they want to damage them.” Abdi added that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was looking for a “free victory” ahead of the country’s parliamentary and presidential elections next month. He noted that the attack came days after Turkey closed its airspace to aircraft travelling to and from Sulaimaniyah due to what it said was intensified activity by PKK fighters, and said the shelling had escalated tensions between the main parties in the Iraqi Kurdish government. Ankara has close ties to the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which is the largest party in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region and is dominant in the regional capital, Erbil. “This tense atmosphere between the two sides of the Kurdish Regional Government comes at a time when the airspace in Turkey remains closed to flights coming from Sulaimaniyah airport, and at a time when many say the differences between both parties of the government should come to an end …."

Turkey has closed its airspace to planes taking off from and landing in Iraq’s northern city of Sulaimaniyah, citing what it said was the heightened presence of Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) fighters there, according to a spokesman from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The director of the airport, Handren al Mufti, said that the airport had received an email from Turkish Airlines on Monday saying that its flights that day and the next were cancelled, before a subsequent email extended the suspension until April 11. The SDF is largely made up of the YPG, which Turkey says is the Syrian wing of the PKK. The incident fueled claims that the PKK was in possession of helicopters, infuriating Turkish authorities. This is not the first time Turkey has closed its airspace to and from the northern Iraqi city, having imposed a similar ban from 2017 to 2019. The PKK and the Turkish state have been embroiled in conflict since the 1980s. Turkey, the United States and European Union have blacklisted the movement as a “terrorist” group. In recent years, Turkey has conducted numerous operations against the PKK in northern Iraq, where the group has bases. Civilians have been caught in the fighting, most notably in July when eight tourists were killed in a Turkish air attack.

The central government of Iraq has reached a deal with the country’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region to resume oil exports from northern Iraq through a pipeline to Turkey. The arbitration ruling urged Turkey to pay $1.4bn to Baghdad for violating agreements by buying oil directly from the KRG. Iraq – the second-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) – filed for the arbitration in question against Turkey in 2014 after the KRG sidelined Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) and began exporting crude oil through the neighbouring country. Iraq claimed that all oil exports had to go through state-owned SOMO under a 1973 agreement with Turkey. The halt to exports through a pipeline to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan had left foreign oil firms with nowhere to pump oil from northern Iraq. Prior to Ankara’s action on March 25, the semi-autonomous region was exporting roughly 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude."

With Turkey becoming the final and 30th member to ratify Finland’s bid on Thursday, the Finns are expected to finalise their membership in the coming days, while Sweden continues to face opposition. Finland President Sauli Niinistö tweeted after Turkey’s decision: “We look forward to welcoming Sweden to join us as soon as possible.” Despite assurances they would be welcomed with “open arms”, their applications quickly ran into opposition, primarily from NATO member Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in mid-March asked parliament to ratify Finland’s bid, but delayed Sweden’s following a litany of disputes. However, Budapest is likely to approve Sweden’s bid if it sees Turkey moving to do so. Sweden, Finland and Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum at a NATO summit in June last year to secure the start of the accession process. However, Ankara has repeatedly butted heads with Stockholm, saying its demands have remained unfulfilled, particularly for the extradition of Turkish citizens that Turkey wants to prosecute for “terrorism”. It has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven for “terrorists”, specifically members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, which, Ankara believes, is linked to the PKK. Talks between Sweden and Turkey have made little progress.

Sweden’s bid to join the alliance, meanwhile, has been left in limbo, with both Turkey and Hungary withholding approval despite expressing support for NATO’s expansion. Turkey’s government has accused Sweden of being too lenient towards Kurdish groups it considers “terrorists” as well as people associated with a 2016 coup attempt. Ankara has also voiced anger over a series of demonstrations in Sweden, including a protest by activists who burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy.

Earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu visited Cairo to hold talks with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry for the first time since bilateral relations were severed about a decade ago. The top Turkish diplomat’s trip to Egypt comes after Shoukry’s landmark visit to Turkey in February following the massive twin earthquakes that killed more than 40,000 people there. Diplomatic ties between Cairo and Ankara were severed in 2013 after Egypt’s current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led the overthrow of then-President Mohamed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest political Islamist group in the Arab world. Morsi was the first democratically elected president of Egypt and had the backing of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP). Since then, Turkey has provided refuge for Egyptian dissidents – many of whom are Muslim Brotherhood leaders who Cairo considers “terrorists” – and allowed them to run satellite television channels that spoke openly against the Egyptian president. Following the coup, regional powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who considered the Muslim Brotherhood a danger to their monarchies, backed el-Sisi and slammed Turkey for backing the organisation. Ankara’s support for its regional ally Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Doha in June 2017 made regional divisions even clearer. According to Turkish foreign policy analyst Semih Idiz, the fact that Doha fixed its relations with its Gulf neighbours and Cairo was a catalyst for Ankara to follow a similar path. “Turkey would be isolated if it did not change its regional policy, so, I believe, the government started fixing its relations with rival powers in the region with the help of Qatar,” he told Al Jazeera. In March 2021, reports began to surface that the Turkish government was restricting the activities of Muslim Brotherhood-aligned media outlets and warning them to change their editorial policies and not to target Egypt and el-Sisi."

At a joint news conference on Saturday Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey would upgrade its diplomatic relations with Egypt to ambassador level “as soon as possible”. Ties between Turkey and Egypt were severely strained after Egypt’s then-army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led the removal of Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, an ally of Ankara, in 2013. Cavusoglu said on Saturday that Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Egypt’s el-Sisi would meet “after the Turkish elections”, including the presidential vote slated for May 14, to mark the end of a decade of estrangement between the two countries. Reporting from Istanbul, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said that two intertwined issues remain unresolved in Egypt-Turkey relations. “Turkey and Egypt are supporting different sides. Turkey is supporting the Tripoli-based internationally recognised government [in Libya] while Egypt is supporting Benghazi, Khalifa Haftar and his army there,” said Serdar. “In 2019, the East Mediterranean Gas Forum was formed … but Turkey has been purposefully excluded. In response, Turkey has signed a maritime deal with the Tripoli-based government,” Serdar added. Consultations between senior foreign ministry officials in Ankara and Cairo began in 2021 amid a push by Turkey to ease tensions with Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Saudi Arabia. As part of that tentative reconciliation, Ankara asked Egyptian opposition TV channels operating in Turkey to moderate their criticism of Egypt. Last month, Shoukry visited Turkey in a show of solidarity after the massive earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey and Syria. Egypt’s government, which has been struggling to manage an acute shortage of foreign currency, said Turkish companies had committed to $500m in new investments in Egypt."

Following years of political animosity, Cairo and Ankara have moved closer in recent years, leaving a large group of Egyptian dissidents in Turkey feeling unsafe. “I’m a toy in a political competition,” said a 29-year-old man who lives in Turkey. Mona T, a 32-year-old woman who left Egypt for Turkey with her son and husband in August 2013, tried to apply for a new passport at the Egyptian consulate in Istanbul in 2019 after hers was stolen. She has since been unable to renew her residence permit in Turkey and has been facing multiple struggles, including possible deportation and losing access to her husband’s health insurance plan despite being diagnosed with an autoimmune condition. Mohamed Mohey, a television news anchor who left Egypt following the 2013 Rabaa massacre, when government forces killed at least 1,000 anti-government protesters, says he has been unable to renew his passport at the Egyptian consulate in Istanbul since 2016.

Erdogan, whose popularity has waned as Turkey’s economic crisis continues, has been accused of authoritarianism by his opponents. His government’s response to February’s devastating earthquakes in the southeast of Turkey, which killed more than 46,000 people and left hundreds of thousands living in tents or temporary accommodation, has also been criticised, although Erdogan has defended the government’s actions.

Many observers think that the political opposition in Turkey has its best chance yet of unseating the long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in May’s presidential election. The opposition – in all its many different forms, including defectors from among Erdogan’s closest allies – has come together in the past few years, and scored some notable victories, such as in the 2019 mayoral races in Istanbul and Ankara. And last month’s devastating earthquakes, which killed more than 45,000 people in Turkey, have led to questions over the government’s response, and the seemingly lax enforcement of housing regulations that are believed to have led to the collapse of so many buildings. And yes, as a member of the Alevi religious minority, he probably won’t appeal to many Turkish nationalists. But then Meral Aksener, leader of the opposition’s main nationalist bloc (there’s a pro-government nationalist bloc, too, stay with me) decided that, well actually, Kilicdaroglu wasn’t up to the job, and publicly announced that the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara would be better choices. A month ago, people went to sleep in their homes, not knowing the destruction that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake was about to bring to southeastern Turkey and northwestern Syria. They could possibly use the recovery plan from the 1999 Marmara earthquake, in northwestern Turkey, as a template for the rebuild, but at the same time, people in Antakya – historic Antioch – are worried that a rush to rebuild ancient sites will threaten the city’s identity and heritage.

Bab al-Hawa, Syria – After seven years apart, Hussein al-Ahmed made the journey from Turkey, and finally reunited with his family in northern Syria. Instead, al-Ahmed is one of the thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey who have taken advantage of a relaxation in regulations following the devastating earthquakes that hit southeastern Turkey and northern Syria a month ago. Turkish authorities now allow Syrian refugees residing in earthquake-hit provinces to voluntarily return to opposition-controlled northwestern Syria and then come back – as long as they do not spend longer than six months away. For Syrians living in the 10 Turkish provinces most deeply affected by the earthquakes, where so many buildings have been destroyed and many remain unsafe, Syria – a country they fled due to the now 12-year war – suddenly looks more appealing, albeit temporarily. “After my sister and I spent 10 days in public parks, I did not have any choice other than return to Syria through the voluntary return system that was announced,” said al-Ahmed, a 30-year-old refugee originally from northern rural Hama who lives in the city of Iskenderun in southern Turkey. The desperate condition of the southern Turkish provinces hit by the earthquakes, and the lack of relatives in other provinces, are among the pull factors that have encouraged some Syrians to make the journey to northern Syria. There, they have relatives and may be able to at least secure a shelter before again considering whether to stay or to return to Turkey, once earthquake-hit areas have been rebuilt. “The number of refugees arriving through the Bab al-Hawa crossing is nearly 15,000,” Mazen Alloush, director of media relations on the Syrian side of the crossing between the country and Turkey, told Al Jazeera. Alloush said that the return programme extends only to holders of the temporary protection permit, and is not open to holders of tourist residency permits, or even dual Syrian-Turkish citizens. A Turkish defence ministry official also told Reuters last week that 40,000 Syrians had returned to their home country. Since April last year, Syrians had been prevented from making round trips back to Syria, and were not allowed to return to Turkey if they crossed the border."

More than 52,000 people were killed in southern Turkey and northwestern Syria by the February 6 tremors. The provisional damage figure, which Vinton said covers only Turkey, is being used as a basis for a donor conference on March 16 in Brussels to raise money for survivors and reconstruction. The World Bank previously estimated the direct damage in Turkey at $34.2bn, but it said recovery and reconstruction costs will be much higher and losses to Turkey’s gross domestic product associated with economic disruptions caused by the quakes will also add to the cost. Vinton said the Turkish government with support from the UNDP, the World Bank and the European Union had calculated far higher damage. Vinton described the scenes in Turkey’s worst-hit Hatay province as “apocalyptic”, saying hundreds of thousands of homes have been destroyed. About two million survivors have been housed in temporary accommodation or evacuated from the earthquake-devastated region, according to Turkish government figures"

The HDP, Turkey’s third-biggest party in the 2018 elections, behind the CHP, is not part of the opposition alliance. However, in 2019, its mainly Kurdish supporters helped the alliance – which it was part of then – win mayoral elections in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities.

The experienced social democratic politician is backed by five smaller parties in an alliance against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The drama within the alliance came about two months before presidential and parliamentary elections, which will be held under poor economic conditions and in the aftermath of last month’s devastating earthquakes, which killed more than 45,000 people in southeastern Turkey and left millions homeless. He graduated from the Ankara Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences (now named Gazi University) in the Turkish capital with an economics degree. Kilicdaroglu held top-level financial and economic roles in Turkish institutions, including the Ministry of Finance, the General Directorate of Revenues and two social security bodies. He taught at Ankara’s Hacettepe University and was a board member of Turkey Is Bank, the largest private bank in the country in terms of its assets. Kilicdaroglu entered parliament as a CHP deputy from Istanbul in the 2002 general elections, which also saw Erdogan’s Justice and Development (AK) Party come to power for the first time after an economic crisis. The CHP and its allies’ most significant success came in the 2019 local elections when the party won mayoral contests in five out of the six largest provinces in the country, including Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey’s financial hub and largest city. She asked the CHP mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavas, to run for president instead. The conflict was resolved on Monday through reported high-level talks as well as a public visit from Imamoglu and Yavas to Aksener at IYI headquarters in Ankara. Galip Dalay, a senior fellow at the Middle East Council, said the tensions between the bloc’s two main parties are not primarily focused on which candidate could win the election but on who would have more influence in post-election Turkey. He was the mayor of the Istanbul district of Beylikduzu for the CHP before winning citywide in a 2019 contest that had to be repeated. He was the mayor of Ankara’s Beypazari district for the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), an ally of Erdogan’s, for two terms."

Our only goal is to take the country to days of prosperity, peace and joy,” Kilicdaroglu, chairman of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), told about 2,000 people gathered in Ankara on Monday. Yet some doubt that the former economist who climbed the ranks as a corruption fighter can defeat Erdogan, Turkey’s longest-serving leader whose campaigning charisma has helped him win more than a dozen election victories. Five parties in the opposition coalition had agreed on Kilicdaroglu’s nomination on Friday, but the bloc splintered after Turkey’s right-wing IYI Party leader Meral Aksener warned the joint candidate risked losing the election. The IYI Party’s proposed presidential candidates — Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavas, the CHP mayors of Istanbul and Ankara respectively — were not accepted by the other five parties. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Ankara, said Kilicdaroglu “is known to have lost nearly every election” he has fought. But his popularity soared after he staged a “Justice March” from Ankara to Istanbul in 2017 to protest a crackdown on journalists and academics following an attempted coup. Turkey’s pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) said it may also support Kilicdaroglu in the presidential election after “clear, open talks”. If we can agree on fundamental principles, we may support him in presidential elections,” party co-leader Mithat Sancar said in a live broadcast on private broadcaster Haberturk.

On February 6, two powerful earthquakes devastated swaths of southern Turkey and northwest Syria, killing more than 50,000 people and destroying tens of thousands of buildings. Sivri, now a 33-year-old freelance journalist living in the Turkish capital, Ankara, reached the Old City on the evening of February 6 and found much of it in ruins. But while the Turkish authorities say the restoration of Antakya’s historic buildings will start imminently, some are cautioning against a rush to rebuild the city’s heritage and warn that its distinctive character and communities are at risk of being lost forever. Hatay only joined Turkey the following year, 16 years after the formation of the modern Turkish Republic. Still, Antakya, home to some 200,000 people, retained more ethnic and religious diversity than most other parts of Turkey. Yahya Coşkun, deputy general director of cultural heritage and museums at Turkey’s culture and tourism ministry, told Al Jazeera that a damage assessment had almost been finished in Antakya and that the crucial pieces of the historic buildings were being salvaged. “What makes Antakya beautiful is its distinctive social fabric, its social coherence, its diverse population, and we should find a way to return these people – Jews, Armenians, Alevis, Orthodox Christians, Turks, Kurds, Syrian refugees – to the city,” he said. Tufan Kaya, a member of Koruma Akademisi, a Turkish NGO which studies and advises on heritage conservation, said that while some restoration projects in Turkey have won international prizes, the country’s record is generally poor. Despite its beauty, much of Antakya was blighted by many of the same issues found in cities across Turkey such as haphazard urban planning, mind-numbing identikit complexes, and a proliferation of cheap and ugly buildings – many of which could not withstand earthquakes because building codes were not enforced. “Turkey’s regulations are perfect on paper,” Kaya said."

An imposing, nearly two-metre-tall engineer, Gencturk saw his popularity rise after none of the buildings he had constructed in the area collapsed in the 1999 earthquake. “1999 taught us something, but [only] on paper,” Gencturk said. Turkish authorities have, during the past month, launched an investigation against more than 600 people over the buildings that collapsed in the February 6 quakes, with 184 suspects jailed pending trial.

Monday’s earthquake became the latest major tremor to rock southern Turkey as the region rebuilds from earlier massive quakes that killed more than 50,000 people across southern Turkey and northwest Syria. Yesilyurt’s Mayor Mehmet Cinar told HaberTurk television that a number of buildings in the town collapsed, including a four-storey building where a father and daughter were trapped. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acknowledged the shortcomings of his government’s response to the February 6 earthquakes as he spoke at a news conference in Adiyaman, one of the provinces hardest hit by the disaster. The United Nations has said at least 1.5 million people have been made homeless in southern Turkey, with more than 500,000 homes needing to be rebuilt. Last week, Turkey said about 865,000 people were living in tents and 23,500 were in container homes, while 376,000 were in student dormitories and public guesthouses outside the earthquake zone. The latest quake comes days after Turkey began an operation to relocate people living in tents to container cities, with the first phase set to move people into 15,000 containers. Turkish authorities have expanded a criminal probe into individuals responsible for buildings levelled by the deadly earthquake that left millions without homes."

Al-Assad has benefitted from an outpouring of Arab support for Syria since February 6 earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people there and in neighbouring Turkey. In Turkey, Shoukry met his counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu in the southern city of Adana, which has been hit by the earthquakes. “[The] Foreign minister offers condolences for the victims of earthquake, affirms solidarity of Egyptian leadership, government and people with Turkey, and asserting continuity of aid for supporting Turkey and its brotherly people,” Ahmed Abu Zeid, spokesperson for Egypt’s Foreign Ministry, said. Shoukry’s visit to Turkey also underlined a new thaw in Egypt’s ties with Ankara. Diplomatic relations were severed after el-Sisi, then the army chief, led the 2013 overthrow of democratically elected President Mohamed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who had enjoyed Turkish support during his short-lived presidency. Turkey has for years served as a refuge for opposition activists from Egypt, further stoking tensions between the two regional powers. However, in recent years Ankara and Cairo have made efforts to mend ties. Turkey and Egypt held their first diplomatic talks in eight years in 2021. During the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shook hands with el-Sisi for the first time, which the Turkish leader described as the first step to launch a new path in relations. While diplomatic relations between Cairo and Ankara have often been thorny, economic ties have continued unabated."
Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/opinions/2023/2/27/turkey-earthquake-diplomacy,"Facing tragedy, Turkey mends ties with Greece and Armenia",27 Feb 2023,"In the past few years, Turkey’s foreign policy has been defined by resets. Ankara has buried the hatchet and re-engaged with several countries it has long been at odds with, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel. Now, the deadly February 6 earthquakes appear to have paved the way for Turkey to mend its ties with yet more of its neighbours. Before the earthquakes, which claimed tens of thousands of lives and flattened entire cities across Turkey’s southeast, the country’s relations with Greece were on the verge of collapse. But everything changed after the earthquakes hit and the scale of devastation Turkey is facing became apparent. Turkey responded with genuine gratitude, leading Dendias to say he welcomes “the shift in Ankara’s tone”. This dramatic improvement in relations in the face of a humanitarian crisis was not particularly surprising for long-term observers of Turkey-Greece relations, as the two countries had successfully engaged in so-called “earthquake diplomacy” for the first time in 1999. Following a deadly quake in Turkey’s northwestern Marmara region in August that year, then-Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou embarked on a journey to improve the neighbouring nations’ relations. The consequent rapprochement paved the way for the EU’s December 1999 decision to grant Turkey official candidate status. The earthquakes also led to an ease in Turkey-Armenia tensions. Putting its longstanding differences and disputes with Ankara aside, the Armenian government sent food, medicine, drinking water and other emergency supplies to devastated cities and towns soon after the quakes. More importantly, the aid from Armenia crossed into Turkey through the land border which has been sealed since the early 1990s. On the back of these goodwill gestures, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan visited Ankara on February 15 to discuss the ongoing efforts to normalise ties between Armenia and Turkey. There is no doubt that Turkey is on significantly better footing to improve its relations with Armenia and Greece now than it was just a month ago. But could the ongoing “earthquake diplomacy” truly transform Turkey’s relations with its two neighbours, both of whom – for reasons of history – loom large in Turkish society’s imagination? Today, amid a global economic downturn and a war at the heart of Europe, Greece has much reason to try and improve its relations with Turkey."

The aftermath of the 7.8- and 7.6-magnitude earthquakes on February 6, which led to more than 44,000 deaths in southern Turkey and more than 5,500 deaths in northern Syria, has seen many Turks question the structural integrity of many of the 173,000 buildings that collapsed or were seriously damaged. AFAD, Turkey’s disaster management agency, said that 9,470 aftershocks had hit the region affected by the quake. “This will continue for a long time … we expect these aftershocks to last for at least two years,” AFAD General Manager Orhan Tatar said in a media briefing in Ankara."

Bor is located some 350km (218 miles) west of the quake-ravaged Turkish-Syrian border region. In the earthquakes that hit earlier this month, more than 44,000 people were killed in Turkey, where 11 provinces were affected, while the latest announced death toll in Syria was 5,914. The earthquakes were followed by more than 9,000 aftershocks, and in Turkey, damaged more than 173,000 buildings and left nearly two million residents homeless, according to government data. Nearly 240,000 rescue workers, including volunteers, continue to work in the 11 quake-hit provinces in Turkey. Fears of another major earthquake have been rekindled in highly populated Istanbul, but a prominent Turkish seismologist has reassured the risk “hasn’t increased”. “The risk hasn’t increased because we are talking about completely different systems,” Dogan Kalafat, the director of the Kandilli Observatory’s Earthquake-Tsunami Monitoring Center in Istanbul, told AFP. Some 20 million people in Turkey have been affected by the quake, while the United Nations estimates 8.8 million people have been affected in Syria."

Some 20 million people in Turkey have been affected by the quake, while the United Nations estimates 8.8 million people have been affected in Syria.

Wearing nothing but her pyjamas, Raghad guided her family through the cold night until she persuaded a bus driver to take 2,000 lira ($106) to drive them to Istanbul, the only place where they have extended family. After a 17-hour journey on snow-covered and damaged roads, they are temporarily safe in Istanbul with the support of Raghad’s uncle and fiancé. According to government estimates, more than 1.7 million Syrian refugees lived in the 10 southern Turkish provinces devastated by this month’s earthquakes. The day after the earthquakes, Turkish authorities issued a directive allowing refugees in the 10 provinces to travel to other cities or provinces, except Istanbul, for up to 90 days if they could secure their own accommodation. But after many refugees fled to Istanbul in the first days following the quakes, the Directorate General of Migration Management revised its decision on a case-by-case basis, allowing families who had already arrived in the metropolis to stay for up to 60 days. “Turkey has some shortcomings in their legal systems as compared to other countries that have ratified the refugee convention without reservation,” he said. “Turkey’s interpretation of the refugee convention has placed limits based on geography – only Europeans in Turkey have the full right to seek asylum, but Turkey made an exception for Syrians, allowing them to become refugees once they are registered.” He added that Turkey’s decision on the movement restrictions was possibly related to the economic difficulties facing the country. “It may have been a way to limit the number of refugees drifting to Istanbul and other big cities,” he said. Syrian activists and human rights organisations have denounced the government directives as “inhumane” and “unrealistic”, saying refugee families would be unable to rebuild their lives in southern Turkey in such a short time. “This 60- to 90-day respite is not realistic because no long-term solutions will be in place by then,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director at Human Rights Watch. Sinclair-Webb called on the Turkish government to devise a “more sustainable, long-term policy that respects people’s rights to establish stable living situations with access to education and employment to sustain and rebuild their lives”."

While shows of global solidarity and pledges of support often accompany massive natural disasters, the reputation cultivated by Ankara in recent years has, at least in part, been reflected in the international response to the devastating earthquakes that have rocked the country and neighbouring Syria since February 6. The disaster has left more than 42,000 people dead in Turkey and killed at least 5,900 in Syria, while crumbling vast swaths of the cityscape and displacing millions. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Washington would continue to provide aid to Turkey “just as Turkey has so often contributed its own humanitarian rescue experts to so many other countries in the past”. The United Nations resident coordinator in Turkey, Alvaro Rodriguez, pointed to the country’s years-long hosting of about 3.7 million Syrian refugees – which has given the country the world’s largest refugee population amid Syria’s continuing war – as well as aid “Turkey has provided other countries in their time of need”. “So, people should remember that and be generous because [Turkey] has been generous to others,” he told Anadolu. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif specifically cited Turkey’s past support as he pledged solidarity, telling Anadolu Agency that Ankara “went the extra mile to help their brothers and sisters, whether it was an earthquake in 2005, floods in 2010, or floods last year in Pakistan”. As of February 18, Turkey said 102 countries had offered assistance, with at least 74 international rescue teams deployed. Analysts say Turkey’s reputation as a global leader in humanitarian aid – a wide category that typically encompasses developmental and emergency assistance – has been part of a swift and deliberate strategy. That enables greater control over where deliveries go while fostering direct engagement with local and national authorities and boosting visibility on the ground, said Volkan Şeyşane, an assistant professor of international relations at Turkey’s Anadolu University."

In the wake of the quakes, Ali Johar, a Rohingya human rights activist, tweeted that his mother had sold her “golden bangle that she saved for family emergency” to support Turkey. “She says, Turkey has been with Rohingya people whenever we faced emergency, we must stand with Turkey in this destitute time,” he wrote. Meanwhile, an Azerbaijani man, identified as Sarvar Bashirli, made headlines in Turkey for driving his dilapidated car across the Central Asian country to collect aid. Efforts have also emerged in the besieged Gaza strip, where Palestinian charity the Islamic Center Charity Society has joined other groups, including the Gaza office of the Arab Medical Union and the al-Amal Institute for Orphans, in launching fundraising appeals for Turkey and Syria. In Greece, thousands of people have responded to calls for aid to quake-hit Turkey, reviving memories of how a spontaneous outpouring of help after a similar disaster in 1999 brought the squabbling neighbours together when they seemed to be on the brink of war.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has stressed Washington’s strong support for Sweden and Finland’s quick NATO accession, even as his Turkish counterpart stressed the need for more concrete action on the part of the Nordic countries. Speaking at a joint press conference after meeting Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Ankara, Blinken stated that the Nordic countries have acted upon the conditions set by Turkey in June last year when it agreed to lift its veto for Sweden and Finland on joining the US-led military alliance. The US’s top diplomat, who is on his first trip to Turkey since his appointment two years ago, said NATO’s Nordic expansion issue was not a bilateral one with Ankara and that Washington supported their accession into the alliance “as quickly as possible”. Washington also reaffirmed its commitment to delivering F-16 jets to Turkey, despite Turkish insistence that their approval should not depend on the lifting of objections to Sweden joining NATO. Turkey wants modernised versions of F-16 fighter jets for its ageing air force, but the US Congress must approve any sale. With his visit coming in the wake of devastating earthquakes that have now killed more than 46,000 people in Turkey and Syria, Blinken also announced $100m in aid to help affected populations. When I visited the Turkish embassy in Washington, I almost couldn’t get in the front door because boxes were piled high throughout the driveway to the embassy. “Turkey faces a long road ahead to support those rendered homeless and to rebuild and we’re committed to providing support.” Blinken also held a closed-door meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara after the news conference. The two NATO bids have been stalled because Turkey has refused to ratify them. Ankara recently indicated it would approve only Finland for accession to NATO, saying Sweden in particular harboured what it calls terrorist groups. Ankara wants Helsinki and Stockholm to take a tougher line against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and another group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt. Erdogan warned Stockholm that it should not expect his backing to join NATO following the burning of the Quran outside Ankara’s embassy."

Khaled said that, beyond free haircuts, his two eldest sons had been volunteering to help others in the camp in a park in the southeastern Turkish city of Antakya. Hamo said he was preparing to go to university soon but would transfer to an institution in the Turkish capital Ankara because of damage done to universities in the earthquake-hit region.

The magnitude 7.8 earthquake that struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on February 6 has killed more than 46,000 people, with the likelihood of finding survivors after two weeks extremely remote. The head of Turkey’s disaster management agency, Yunus Sezer, on Sunday said search and rescue efforts had been completed in all provinces apart from Hatay and Kahramanmaras, the earthquake’s epicentre. Sezer also said Turkey’s death toll had risen to 41,020. Some 105,794 buildings checked by Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Urbanization are either destroyed or so badly damaged as to require demolition, the ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The figures were for Turkey and did not cover collapsed and damaged buildings in neighbouring Syria. The winding-down of rescue operations came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey to show solidarity with the NATO ally and announce a new aid package worth $100m. On Twitter, the White Helmets civil defence group said they had met Blinken in southern Turkey to discuss “the response to the earthquake in NW #Syria, the humanitarian situation, ways to support affected civilians, and mechanisms for achieving early recovery”."

The visit came as Turkey ended rescue efforts in all provinces except the two hardest hit by last week’s massive quake that killed tens of thousands of people, the disaster agency said on Sunday. They continue in Kahramanmaras and Hatay provinces,” the agency’s chief Yunus Sezer told reporters in Ankara. US President Joe Biden announced $85m for Turkey and Syria days after the earthquake, which has killed more than 46,000 people in the two countries. “This is going to be a long-term effort,” Blinken said on Sunday at Incirlik Air Base, a joint US-Turkish facility that has coordinated the distribution of disaster aid. The secretary of state is making his first trip to NATO ally Turkey since he took office two years ago. Blinken flew over Turkey’s devastated Hatay region from the air with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. Blinken is set to fly to Ankara, Turkey’s capital, later for discussions with Turkish officials on Monday, including an anticipated meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. As well as the effects of the earthquake, Blinken is expected to discuss Sweden and Finland’s efforts to join NATO, which Turkey has delayed. Sweden and Finland applied last year to join the trans-Atlantic defence pact after Russia invaded Ukraine, but the two countries have faced unexpected objections from Turkey and have since sought to win its support. Ankara wants Helsinki and Stockholm to take a tougher line against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is considered a “terrorist” group by Turkey and the European Union, and another group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt. A husband and wife have been rescued 12 days after earthquakes in Turkey – they were buried under rubble for 296 hours."

The World Health Organization estimates that some 26 million people across both Turkey and Syria need humanitarian aid. Twelve days after the earthquakes, rescue workers from Kyrgyzstan saved several members of a Syrian family of five on Saturday from the rubble of a building in Antakya in southern Turkey. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu reporting from Ankara said many survivors were hoping the search and rescue operations would continue for longer. There are health fears on the Turkish side as well, with doctors on the ground pointing to the lack of sanitation, safe water, and the overcrowding of shelters are hazards that could result in the spread of disease. Northwestern Syria had a wait of three long days after the earthquake struck before aid convoys were able to navigate damaged Turkish roads and pass through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, which was the only UN-approved land crossing into this opposition-controlled region where a number of armed groups at war with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are active. Since then, the UN has apologised for the delay and begun using two other land crossings from Turkey into northern Syria. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is expected to travel to Turkey and meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sources familiar with the plan told Reuters. Since the earthquake, the US has sent a search and rescue team to Turkey, medical supplies, concrete-breaking machinery, and additional funding of $85m in humanitarian aid that also covers Syria."

Workers from Kyrgyzstan on Saturday tried to save a Syrian family of five from the rubble of a building in Antakya city in southern Turkey. WFP Director David Beasley has said the agency was running out of supplies there and called for more border crossings to be opened from Turkey.

Turkish authorities have said that about 13.5 million people have been affected and Erdogan said on Wednesday that the state will rebuild all collapsed buildings in all 10 provinces affected by the earthquake within a year. Bekir Bozdag, the Turkish minister of justice, has said that an investigation into the collapsed buildings would be launched and authorities have ordered the arrest of more than 100 people suspected of being responsible for collapsed buildings. In stark contrast to the affected areas of Turkey, Syria’s opposition-held northwest has largely been neglected in terms of international rescue and search operations and humanitarian aid."

Last week’s earthquakes that hit southern Turkey and northwest Syria have killed at least 36,187 people in southern Turkey, according to the country’s disaster management agency. The 5.1-magnitude earthquake, reportedly centred in Antakya, in southern Turkey, pushed people back onto the streets as they feared the collapse of their homes. Dozens of arms frantically reach for heaters and blankets handed out by a private donor, illustrating the desperation and rage gripping swathes of Turkey 11 days after its disastrous earthquake. Seren Ay Cetin, a Turkish female boxer who won the 2022 World Boxing Council (WBC) title, is auctioning her championship belt to help earthquake victims in Turkey. In a tweet, Seren Ay Cetin, 26, said she would put her WBC Silver Bantamweight title belt on auction, hoping to sell it for at least one million Turkish liras or $53,000. She promised to give all the proceeds to Ahbap, a Turkish non-governmental organisation helping the victims.

The Red Cross has more than tripled its emergency funding appeal to over $700m for aid to victims of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria last week.

Mahmoud Joulaq, a bakery supervisor in Jandaris, told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that the quake-stricken areas of northwestern Syria are now facing a bread crisis after bakeries closed down and the import of flour from across the border in Turkey came to a halt. The roads leading to Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salama, two crossings along the Syria-Turkey border, were cut off due damage caused by the quakes, stopping the transport of flour and raw materials into Jandaris. He said that before the quake, 80 percent of all foodstuffs in northwestern Syria came through the border crossings with Turkey. According to Mazen Alloush, director of media and public relations at the Bab al-Hawa border crossing, no commercial goods nor aid entered northwestern Syria through the crossing for a week after the earthquakes struck Turkey and Syria. “In 2022, approximately 75,000 commercial trucks entered northern Syria through the Bab al-Hawa crossing, in addition to a similar number of export trucks that went to Turkey,” Alloush said."

Since two huge earthquakes (magnitude 7.8 and 7.6) and hundreds of aftershocks destroyed much of 10 provinces in southeastern Turkey, 1,413 Syrians have returned to their home country in body bags as of Wednesday morning. Most, if not all, of those passing through Bab al-Hawa had been living in Hatay province, which has arguably seen the worst devastation in Turkey. A municipality truck waits, it spends the day crossing the border to unload the bodies, then loops back to Turkey to pick up more. Those family members who live in Turkey had to say their final goodbyes to loved ones on the back of the truck, due to Turkey not allowing Syrian nationals to re-enter if they cross the border. However, as of February 15, according to the Syrian Bab al-Hawa Office, Turkey will permit all Syrians living in the 10 provinces affected by the earthquake, to cross the border for a period of up to three months before returning. Hundreds more victims from Syrian regime-held areas have been laid to rest in Turkey considering they, even in death, cannot cross the frozen front line to the villages they once fled from. More than a week after the quakes, parts of the cities have started to smell of death, with the death toll in Turkey crossing 35,000 and close to 6,000 in Syria."

Telci met the family after they travelled to Istanbul, and then drove them to one of his family’s summer homes in Yalova, a northwestern coastal city along the Sea of Marmara. They are among Turkish families across the country who are connecting with quake-stricken survivors through word of mouth, social media and the help of local authorities, and then giving shelter to the earthquake victims. Located more than 500km (310 miles) north of the site of the deadly quakes that have left more than 41,000 people dead in Turkey and Syria, this small village of only a few hundred people is now hosting several families from Malatya – one of the 10 worst-hit southern Turkish provinces. With the help of family and friends in Germany, Arslan has so far fundraised more than 90,000 Turkish lira ($4,700) to support the families, securing everything from clothing to food and medication. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has promised a sum of 10,000 lire ($530) for each affected household and promised to rebuild the destroyed homes within a year.

NATO’s secretary-general has said it is more important that Finland and Sweden join the military alliance quickly rather than at the same time amid tensions between the pair and Turkey, which has refused to ratify the Nordic nations’ membership bids. Their respective membership bids have been ratified by all 30 of the transatlantic alliance’s member states, except Hungary and Turkey, which is widely seen as the main hold-up to their joining. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has indicated his country could ratify Finland’s application even while continuing to block Sweden’s. “Our position on Finland is positive, but it is not positive on Sweden,” he told Turkish parliamentarians at the beginning of February. Ankara has accused the government in Stockholm of being too lenient toward groups it deems to be “terrorist” organisations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups. Earlier this month, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland joining NATO. Turkey is in an election year, and the topic of Nordic membership of NATO could be a vote winner.

A young girl named Miray was recovered alive in the southeastern Turkish city of Adiyaman and crews were reportedly close to reaching her sister as well. Stories of near-miraculous rescues have flooded the airwaves in recent days, including many that were broadcast live on Turkish television and beamed around the world. Still, thousands of rescue teams – including Turkish coal miners and experts aided by sniffer dogs and thermal cameras – were searching pulverised apartment blocks for signs of life.

The Turkish toll now exceeds the 31,643 killed in a quake in 1939, Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said, making it the worst quake in the country’s modern history. The Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, a nongovernmental business organisation, estimated the quake’s financial damage in Turkey alone at $84.1bn.

Scientists who talked to Al Jazeera said a major temblor is highly likely to strike Turkey’s largest city as the nation mourns the deaths of tens of thousands of people in the country’s southeast a week ago. The twin tremors affected 10 provinces in Turkey and killed thousands of others in Syria, and the death toll continues to rise in both countries. The massive disaster raised the question of earthquake preparedness in Istanbul, Turkey’s business and tourism capital hosting some 16 million people. Sukru Ersoy, a professor of geology at Turkey’s Yildiz Technical University, said historical data of past earthquakes suggests that one on the fault line under the Marmara Sea is near. Huseyin Alan, chairman of the Chamber of Geological Engineers, agreed: “A magnitude 7.0 or higher earthquake is expected in Istanbul according to the data we have.” A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the western part of Turkey’s Marmara region in August 1999 and killed at least 17,500 people. Turkey is located in a region that harbours several tectonic plates, and earthquakes are much more likely to happen around the borders between plates. The North Anatolian Fault line divides the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, and it goes through the Marmara Sea, which is south of Istanbul. Istanbul produced 30.4 percent of Turkey’s gross domestic product in 2021, according to official data, making it the heart of economic activity in the country. The megalopolis also hosts the country’s most vital production facilities that could deeply hurt Turkey’s industrial sector if they are damaged by a powerful temblor. Ersoy said severe seismic activity affecting Istanbul and the rest of the country should be at the top of the agenda for authorities. “[Preparing for] earthquakes should be the top project in both Istanbul and Turkey. We should start now, start fast and mobilise all the resources to prepare for an earthquake in Istanbul,” he said."

Canlı!” has been the most hopeful cry heard in the streets of Antakya since a magnitude 7.8 earthquake sent waves of death and destruction across 10 provinces in southern Turkey as well as parts of Syria a week ago. Turkey’s megacity Istanbul should start preparing now for a powerful earthquake that could strike at anytime and mobilise all available resources to save lives and lessen the economic impact, experts say. Hundreds of people were killed in Istanbul in a 1999 magnitude 7.6 earthquake with an epicentre located about 100km (65 miles) southeast of the city. Scientists who talked to Al Jazeera said another major temblor is highly likely to strike Turkey’s largest city as the nation mourns the deaths of tens of thousands of people in the country’s southeast a week ago. The number of Syrians killed in last week’s earthquakes who have been brought back to their country from Turkey through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing has risen to 1,302, a border official tells Al Jazeera. The United States is prepared to provide any aid required for earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria, the White House says as it also urges the UN to open additional border crossings to Syria. Turkish President Erdogan has announced that university accommodation will be used to house those affected by the earthquakes. Students in Istanbul have been leaving their university dorms to make room for survivors. More than a million people have been made homeless by last week’s quakes, and authorities in Turkey and Syria are trying to find places for them to stay. Last week’s earthquakes have aggravated tensions between Turks and Syrian refugees as some Turks in quake-hit towns and cities have accused Syrians of robbing damaged shops and homes. Turkey has taken in nearly 4 million Syrian refugees after opening its borders to those fleeing the war that erupted there in 2011.

As Turkey reels from its deadliest earthquake in decades, some residents of Istanbul have already turned their growing anxiety elsewhere – towards the next big quake. “We live in distress,” said Aysegul Rahvanci, a lifetime Istanbul resident, of her fears about a possible strong earthquake in the city. Many people living in Turkey’s largest city shared Rahvanci’s feelings, in particular following the massive earthquakes – with magnitudes of 7.8 and 7.6 –  on Monday that killed more than 21,000 people and wounded more than 80,000 others in southeastern Turkey as of Saturday. The North Anatolian Fault, which divides the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, runs close to Istanbul. According to Sukru Ersoy, a professor of geology from Istanbul’s Yildiz Technical University, the question is when a powerful earthquake will hit Istanbul, not if it will happen. “With the data we have on the past earthquakes, and through certain modellings, we can say that an Istanbul earthquake is near and we would not even be surprised if the city is hit by it today,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that it was impossible to know when the disaster would take place. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said in a recent interview that there were some 90,000 buildings that were highly vulnerable to earthquakes in the megalopolis with a population of some 16 million people. The mayor said another 170,000 buildings were in the medium-risk status in case of a strong earthquake, according to research conducted by Istanbul Municipality. After Monday’s earthquakes, more than 6,400 buildings have reportedly collapsed in southeastern Turkey. Istanbul residents watched the news coming from southeastern Turkey in shock, knowing that experts have said an earthquake in Istanbul is highly likely. The government improved its construction regulations after a magnitude-7.6 quake hit the eastern part of Turkey’s Marmara region, where Istanbul is also located, in 1999 and killed some 17,500 people. After that earthquake, the Turkish seismic design code was enhanced and in late 2000s, the Turkish government launched a large-scale urban transformation plan to replace the buildings unsafe for earthquakes with new seismically improved ones."

The first earthquake’s epicentre, about 33 kilometres (20 miles) from the city of Gaziantep, a major city and provincial capital in southeastern Turkey, is home to millions of Syrian refugees living in southern Turkey. Most of them were displaced and living in the city of Antakya in Turkey’s Hatay province, which has been almost entirely destroyed. “It has been a challenge to ask the Turkish authorities for rescuers and resources to remove the bodies. The World Health Organization has warned that more than 23 million people could be affected by the massive earthquakes which have devastated Turkey and Syria. In Turkey, a state of emergency has been declared in 10 provinces along its southern border with Syria. Thousands of buildings, including schools and hospitals, have been damaged in Turkey and Syria. An estimated 6,000 to 7,000 buildings have collapsed in Turkey as a result of Monday’s quakes. The earthquakes also caused a massive fire at Iskenderun port on Turkey’s southern coast, setting hundreds of shipping containers on fire and causing immense damage before the blaze was finally extinguished. Most of Turkey is on the Anatolian plate, and is surrounded by the Eurasian, African and Arabian plates. Turkey has experienced many significant earthquakes throughout its history. Besides being earthquake-prone, Turkey is among the countries with the highest number of fatalities due to earthquakes, according to the International Disasters Database (EM-DAT). “On paper, Turkey’s seismic design code is up to global standards — it is actually better than most,” Sinan Turkkan, civil engineer and president of Turkey’s Earthquake Retrofit Association, told Al Jazeera. In 2017, the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects warned that as many as seven million buildings out of a total 20 million structures across the country were at risk of collapsing in the event of an earthquake."

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had long worked with and supported the Syrian rebels who marched on Damascus this month and forced President Bashar al-Assad to flee. That carefully cultivated relationship opens up “an incredibly big domain for economic and political influence,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a visiting fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington with a particular focus on Turkey. “But what is uncontestable is that Turkey’s influence will only grow, economically and politically.” In the process, Turkey appears to have also weakened the regional influence of Russia, which along with Iran was a key backer of the Syrian president, she said.

An ancient bronze thought to be a likeness of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus is to be reunited with its long lost torso after a Danish museum agreed that its sculpture of a bearded man’s head had been looted and should be returned to Turkey. The torso, which for years stood in the Roman Court of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, was returned to Turkey in 2023 after its seizure by investigators who said it had been looted. Since then, the Turkish government has been petitioning the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, requesting the return of the 2,000-year-old head to complete the statue. Last week, the Danish museum said its researchers had concluded that the artifact, which has been in its collection since 1970, was likely to have been excavated illegally from Bubon, a site in the southwest of Turkey that investigators say was heavily looted in the 1960s."

This week, one of Turkey’s most powerful politicians made a surprising offer to the militant leader he has long branded a “baby killer” and “chief terrorist.” If Abdullah Ocalan, the leader of the main group fighting for greater autonomy for Turkey’s Kurdish minority, would come to Parliament, renounce militancy and disband his organization, the politician said, it could open a pathway to end his life sentence in a Turkish prison. The offer by the politician, Devlet Bahceli, fell far short of a breakthrough in efforts to end decades of bloody conflict between the Turkish state and Mr. Ocalan’s group, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or P.K.K. But it was one of several recent gestures suggesting a new openness in the Turkish government to the possibility of revived peace talks. Turkey has been trying to stamp out the P.K.K. since its founding as an underground militant organization in 1984. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the years since in P.K.K. guerrilla attacks and the Turkish military’s responses. Turkey and its Western allies consider the group a terrorist organization. The Turkish authorities captured Mr. Ocalan in 1999 and sentenced him to life in prison, locking him up on an island in the Sea of Marmara, where he was for many years the only prisoner.

During his own rise as an Islamist politician in a staunchly secular country, Mr. Erdogan found useful allies in Mr. Gulen’s followers, who also used Islam as their guide in the prominent positions they held in Turkey’s judiciary, police forces and news media. But the two men later became enemies, and in 2016 the Turkish government designated Mr. Gulen’s movement a terrorist organization. Nearly a decade after the failed coup and more than two decades since he left Turkey for the United States, Mr. Gulen’s image still loomed large as a key irritant in U.S.-Turkey relations and for Mr. Erdogan, who wanted the cleric sent back to Turkey to stand trial. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, on Monday confirmed Mr. Gulen’s death, calling him the leader of a “dark organization.” Suggesting that Mr. Gulen’s movement still posed a threat to Turkey, Mr. Fidan urged its followers to cut ties.

Designed by the American architecture firm Perkins Eastman, it was built by the construction arm of a large Turkish holding company, IC Holding, which has done high-profile projects in Turkey that are closely associated with Mr. Erdogan. Its design features traditional Turkish patterns, and a glowing line runs up one of its corners in red, the color of the Turkish flag.

Vivian Yee reported from Cairo and Safak Timur from Istanbul. When the prisoners traded by Russia, the United States, Germany and other countries walked toward home and freedom on Thursday, they did so on increasingly familiar ground for prisoner swaps — in Turkey, a country that has molded itself into an important go-between for Moscow and the West since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It was unclear how important a role Turkey played in the many months of negotiations that led to Thursday’s swap. Still, the fact that the complex, multicountry exchange occurred on Turkish soil allowed the country to cast itself as a key player on the world stage. It also allowed Turkey to try to put a positive spin on its sometimes tense relations with its NATO allies, many of which have been frustrated that the country declined to join Western sanctions on Russia and expanded economic ties with Moscow even as the West tried to isolate it. A statement attributed to Turkish security officials and shared by Turkey’s government media office celebrated the moment of the prisoner exchange as historic, and President Biden, in remarks from the White House on Thursday, named Turkey among the nations that had “stepped up” to help bring the prisoners home. The Turkish statement said the country’s intelligence agency, known by its Turkish initials, MIT, had overseen the physical exchange on Thursday as the prisoners left the Russian plane that had brought them to the Ankara airport and had performed health checks.

In response, fighters across the border in northern Syria have confronted Turkish soldiers. Reporting from Ankara, Turkey Over the past two days, angry groups of men in a half-dozen cities in Turkey have turned on the Syrian refugees living among them, damaging their shops and cars and assaulting them with fists and knives. Across the border in parts of northern Syria where Turkey holds sway, Syrians have confronted the Turkish soldiers in their midst, pelting their vehicles with rocks, tearing down Turkish flags and condemning them in street protests. The scattered violence, which has left at least seven people dead in Syria, according to a war monitor, has exposed growing cracks in the coexistence between Syrians and Turks on both sides of their shared border. Many Turks have come to resent the 3.1 million Syrian refugees in their country and accuse them, with or without evidence, of fueling economic troubles that include low wages and persistent inflation that exceeded 75 percent in May. And many Syrians who oppose the government of President Bashar al-Assad have gone from viewing Turkey as their greatest protector to fearing that it will abandon them. Support for the idea of sending Syrian refugees home has spread across Turkey’s political spectrum. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who cut ties with Syria in 2011 and backed the rebels seeking to topple Mr. al-Assad, said last week he would not rule out meeting his former foe to try to restore ties.

Tells Congress It Has Approved Sale of F-16 Jets to Turkey,"Jan. 26, 2024","The department received documents on Friday signed by Turkey’s leader approving Sweden’s long-delayed entry into NATO. The State Department notified Congress on Friday that it had approved a $23 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets and related equipment to Turkey after the country’s leader signed documents to allow Sweden’s long-delayed entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, department officials and the Pentagon said. Although Congress could move to formally block the sale, four senior lawmakers told the State Department on Friday evening that they would not object, after their aides reviewed the documents signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, U.S. officials said. Congressional officials had demanded to see the documents before signaling their approval of the sale, so the State Department asked Turkey to fly the documents to New York on Friday. The department’s subsequent formal notification to Congress means the sale will almost certainly occur, satisfying Mr. Erdogan’s main condition for supporting Sweden’s accession to NATO and potentially helping bring to a close an episode that has strained relations between the United States and Turkey. Turkey was, along with Hungary, one of two NATO members withholding approval of Sweden’s entry into the alliance. Blinken had undertaken intense diplomacy since last year, including meeting with Mr. Erdogan in Istanbul this month, to try to change the Turkish leader’s mind. Mr. Blinken discussed the issue with Mr. Erdogan in a visit to Turkey in February 2023, and said three times that Turkey would not get the F-16s if it refused to approve Sweden’s accession, a U.S. official said."

President Biden sent a letter to four senior members of Congress on Wednesday urging them to quickly approve a $20 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, following the vote one day earlier by Turkey’s Parliament to allow Sweden to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, according to three U.S. officials. As of Wednesday night, the four senior lawmakers had not given their approval, and one or more of them might ask the Biden administration to give assurances about Turkey’s actions on some foreign policy issues before agreeing to the transfer, a congressional official said. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a member of NATO, has linked his country’s approval of Sweden’s accession to the security organization to the F-16 sales, which had been pending. Turkey approved Finland’s bid but, along with Hungary, has withheld approval for Sweden. Blinken met with Mr. Erdogan in Istanbul this month and pushed him to have Turkey approve Sweden’s accession. However, congressional officials have gone back to the department repeatedly with questions about how Turkey might use the jets, as well as some of Turkey’s foreign policy moves that seem to run counter to U.S. interests. One issue is the fact that the Turkish military has carried out a growing number of airstrikes on Kurdish militias in northeast Syria who have worked with the U.S. military to fight the Islamic State. Turkish leaders consider the Kurdish fighters to be members of a terrorist group. Members of Congress and aides remain concerned about Turkey’s aggression, one official said. The congressional officials also want to see assurances by Turkey of when the formal ratification of Sweden’s accession will move onward from Mr. Erdogan’s office. And they are asking the State Department to provide them with a document that Turkey has supposedly sent the department saying that the Turkish military intends to de-escalate any tensions with the Greek military in the Aegean Sea, the official said."

Before taking on the role of lead curator, Blazwick had been a member of a four-person advisory panel that considered applications for the job and which initially recommended that Defne Ayas, a Turkish curator, should oversee the next edition, its 18th. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts did not respond to an emailed inquiry about why it had rejected Ayas, but art world insiders have theorized that it was because her selection would have been politically inflammatory in Turkey.

Since Sweden applied to join NATO after the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, Turkey has repeatedly delayed the process, saying that Sweden, the United States and Canada all needed to meet Turkish demands. Turkey initially blocked them both, and although it has since relented on Finland, paving the way for that country to join NATO in March, Turkey has continued to hold out on Sweden. “We welcome that the foreign affairs committee in Turkey approved Sweden’s NATO application,” Sweden’s foreign minister, Tobias Billstrom, wrote Tuesday on the social media platform X. Multiple NATO leaders have said that Sweden has done all that is needed to join, and Turkey’s repeated delays in approving Sweden’s entry have exasperated other members of the alliance, who view Turkey as leveraging its position for domestic gain. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in addition to arguing that Sweden needs to crack down more on dissidents whom his country considers terrorists, has linked the approval of Sweden’s accession to disputes that Turkey has with other NATO members. From the United States, Turkey wants a $20 billion package of American-made F-16 fighter jets and upgrade kits for jets that it already has. The Biden administration has said that it supports the sale, but members of Congress have objected, citing Turkey’s human rights record and its stance on Sweden. Mr. Erdogan has also noted that the decision on Sweden lies with the Turkish Parliament, not with him, although his party and its political allies hold a commanding share of votes that could easily pass the measure. “If you have your Congress, I have my Parliament,” Mr. Erdogan told Turkish journalists in comments published on Dec. Mr. Erdogan has also tried to use Sweden’s NATO bid to pressure Canada, another NATO member, which has imposed export restrictions on optical equipment that Turkey uses in its drones.

Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog post last week that thanks to years of bad policies, Turkey faces “what appears to be an imminent financial crisis.” Erkan’s tenure at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey will be closely watched for many reasons, only one of which is that she’s the first woman in the post. Turkey is a vital player in diplomacy — a member of NATO that is playing a delicate game in the war at its doorstep. It “has consistently supported Ukraine politically and militarily without alienating Russia economically,” Yevgeniya Gaber, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Turkey, wrote recently. Turkey also has the world’s 19th-largest economy, with a gross domestic product of nearly $1 trillion a year, according to the World Bank. Solving a currency crisis in a country as big as Turkey wouldn’t be easy for the International Monetary Fund, nor is it clear that Turkey would be willing to accept the I.M.F.’s conditions to get its money.

Before Erdogan came along, Turkish politics tended to be dominated by elites in the big cities, very much steeped in this idea that, even though it’s a Muslim-majority society, it was a staunchly secular place. He grew up in a poor, tough neighborhood in Istanbul. He serves a stint as the mayor of Istanbul in the ‘90s and is celebrated all around. And this is basically a protest vote by Turks who were so angry at the way that the previous parties had been running the country that they decided to give these guys a chance. And then Turkey really takes off. During his first decade as the prime minister, Turkey’s GDP more than tripled. And so, for people living in Turkey, the country really goes from a place where a lot of people are poor and don’t have great services to a place where a lot of people are middle class and can really take advantage of it. I mean, this was a revolution in Turkish politics. I mean, this was not typical for a Turkish leader, and people really loved him for it.

Renaissance Residence was a testament to Turkey’s grand ambitions, a large, iconic project designed to meet the rising expectations of an expanding middle class in a rapidly developing part of the country. Across southern Turkey, the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and a second major tremor hours later killed more than 50,000 people and devastated hundreds of thousands of buildings. Renaissance was a product of a building boom throughout Turkey, a pillar of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s plans for development and economic growth. Over his 20 years as Turkey’s predominant politician, new apartment buildings, malls, skyscrapers and neighborhoods have sprouted across the country. Turkey Turkey Citing Turkish government data, they said the building had faced extraordinarily high levels of ground motion, which caused the land around Renaissance to behave like liquid, a phenomenon called liquefaction. “We are aware there are likely some issues with the ground motion data collected during the Turkish earthquakes,” said Christine Goulet, director of the United States Geological Survey’s Earthquake Science Center. Most buildings around Renaissance remained standing, noted Baris Erkus, a structural engineer based in Istanbul who visited the site and dozens of others after the quake. It was a stunningly big building for such a rural area, and common only in dense parts of Turkey’s largest cities, urban planners said. Construction was booming across Turkey at the time, so it was normal to get such zoning, he said. The attendees included the provincial governor appointed by Mr. Erdogan’s cabinet, later made Turkey’s national police chief. Under Turkish regulations, Renaissance had to be inspected frequently during construction. Ilkay Teltik, a member of the Istanbul Chamber of Construction Engineers who reviewed the documents, described them as “perfunctory and sloppy,” with missing dates and other key details, such as the exact locations that concrete samples were taken from. In the months since the earthquake, Turkish prosecutors have been investigating Renaissance over the collapse and deaths. The Turkish authorities are seeking his extradition. The initial earthquake hit southern Turkey at 4:17 a.m. local time."

The journalist Andrew Finkel wrote in April of that year that “Turks carry in their wallets 10-million-lira bills, the highest denominated note in the world, and after the recent debacle worth well under $10.” The crisis was said to have been set off by a disagreement between Turkey’s president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, and prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, over the pace of anticorruption efforts.

So, Ben, we’re now at more than 50,000 dead in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. You’ve been investigating that question in Turkey, where the loss of life was, by far, the greatest. Turkish authorities have issued arrest warrants for over 100 people. I mean, we, me and my colleagues here in Istanbul, started looking into this, investigating who these people were, how the industry works, and just trying to figure out how did these buildings get built and what were the problems. This was when you had the last, really, massive earthquake in Turkey. Desperate rescue efforts were underway in western Turkey today after a massive earthquake struck during the night. This is a very powerful earthquake that hits the city of Izmit, which is not far from Istanbul.

Green fields on the outskirts of Istanbul, fields that will soon be transformed into a massive building site. There’ll be upmarket properties designed to appeal to Turkey’s burgeoning middle classes. This idea that you as a Turkish family can have your own apartment in a nice city, this becomes a reality for huge parts of the population that were, before, quite impoverished. So Erdogan’s solution after the 1999 earthquake and economic crisis is to actually invest in building and development as a way to revive Turkey’s economy. But the dark side of all this construction is that Turkey has very, very active fault lines in large parts of the country. But where Turkey’s at now, everybody that we talk to basically said the codes are world class. So the Turkish government realizes there’s a risk to all this construction. So, Ben, you’ve just finished telling us that Turkey’s earthquake codes were really world class, but they weren’t really enforced."

The quake, which has killed over 40,000 people in Turkey and thousands more in neighboring Syria, will saddle Ankara with a staggering reconstruction bill and weakened economic growth, posing a fresh challenge to Mr. Erdogan as he seeks a third five-year term and maintain a grip on his political fortunes ahead of a crucial presidential election in May. Before the devastation, which also left millions homeless, Turkey was already reeling from a collapsing currency and runaway inflation that had reached an annual rate of 85 percent in October. Those vulnerabilities have punched holes in the nation’s balance sheet and tipped Turkish families and businesses into a cost-of-living crisis. Aggravating the problems are unorthodox financial policies pursued by Mr. Erdogan, a strongman leader who has tightened his control over the economy and strengthened ties with Russia and the Gulf States to help bolster Turkey’s finances. Reconstruction is expected to cost $10 billion to $50 billion, although the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation has put the total closer to $85 billion. Over 8,000 buildings were flattened and supply chain infrastructure, including roads and the Iskenderun seaport, were damaged when the quake rocked southern Turkey. The area, a manufacturing and maritime transport hub that was also home to thousands of war-hit Syrian refugees, accounts for 9 percent of Turkey’s economic activity.

His critics counter that he has used his many years as Turkey’s top politician to concentrate power in his own hands and is now using it to shape the outcome of the election before voters even go to the polls. “Erdogan is trying to fight this battle on ground he chooses, under the framework that he determines, with the weapons that he picks, and preferably with the opponent that he prefers,” said Ahmet Kasim Han, a professor of international relations at Beykoz University in Istanbul. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article described incorrectly Turkey’s rate of inflation. Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief."

The $20 billion arms package for Turkey would include 40 new F-16 fighter jets and 79 upgrade kits to refurbish the country’s existing fleet of aging F-16s. But while Turkey is a NATO ally of more than 70 years, that package faces skepticism from members of Congress who are exasperated with the country’s autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, including over his violation of civil liberties and his refusal so far to approve NATO membership for Sweden and Finland. While saying he welcomed selling the next-generation F-35s to Greece, Mr. Menendez — whose position gives him the power to block such sales in his committee — said he “strongly” opposed selling “new F-16 aircraft to Turkey.”"

As European nations opposed to the invasion of Ukraine have moved to reduce their dependence on Russian oil and gas, enduring soaring price increases and possible shortages, Turkey has deepened its energy ties to Russia. Since the war started, Turkey’s imports of Russian crude oil and coal have climbed sharply. The presidents of both countries have talked about how to turn Turkey into a regional trading center for Russian gas. And Turkey has suggested building a second nuclear power plant designed and financed by Russia in addition to the one already scheduled to come online next year. Cheaper energy is helping to keep Turkey’s sinking economy afloat at a critical time. But the maneuvers are also part of an attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to use the energy crisis to advance a longstanding dream of the Turks to become a major energy hub. Its location between Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East puts Turkey in a pivotal spot. Turkey’s growing role in the world’s energy trade was on notable display this week as the European Union’s embargo of seaborne Russian crude went into effect along with the imposition of an American-led price cap on Russian oil. More than 20 oil tankers, most with no ties to Russia, sat in Turkish waters, waiting for permission to make their way through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits into the Mediterranean Sea. Turkey has demanded additional proof of insurance, saying the price cap has increased the risk of uninsured tankers off its coast. On Friday a Russian delegation reportedly visited Ankara to discuss Turkey’s request for a 25 percent discount on natural gas.

It may not be a pleasure exactly, but it’s your solemn duty to live one more day.” The rebellious Turkish novelist Sevgi Soysal (1936-76) did just that, her life stranger than fiction. After the military coup in Turkey on March 12, 1971, amid a period of labor unrest and street battles between leftists and ultranationalists, Soysal spent a portion of her final years in detention, writing at a furious pace. She also served out a sentence of internal exile in southern Turkey. Shaped by those experiences, Soysal’s short stories and novels — written in the 1960s and ’70s at the height of social tumult in Turkey, and no doubt colored by the Cold War — are fonts of political insight and meticulous studies of emotion. The ingenuity of “Dawn” lies in its chorus of wounded, weary, angry voices from all corners of Turkish society. Soysal was born to a Turkish father and German mother, neither of whom was politically active. She was raised in Ankara amid the idealism of the early Turkish Republic, flitting between dance and piano lessons. After her return to Turkey, Soysal began writing fiction in earnest as well as voraciously translating plays from the German. In the mid-60s, she took a job at Turkish Radio and Television, Turkey’s version of the BBC."

The bombing, on Sunday on a crowded shopping street popular with both Turks and tourists, killed six people — all of them Turkish nationals — who belonged to three different families, according to officials. It was the deadliest such attack in Turkey in more than five years, raising painful memories of the days when bombings by Kurdish and Islamic State militants often struck Turkish cities. Turkey accused the United States of complicity in the attack because America has long maintained a military partnership with a Kurdish-led militia in Syria. The United States is an ally of Turkey in NATO, but Mr. Soylu’s accusation of complicity was rooted in the longstanding U.S. partnership with a Kurdish-led militia in northeastern Syria formed to battle the Islamic State, which ruled a so-called caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq for years.

It was there that I was put on trial for writing “The Bastard of Istanbul,” a novel that reflected on minorities, memory and collective amnesia, and that unspeakable taboo, the Armenian genocide. From sexuality to politics to everyday life, the lack of freedom of speech in every sphere and the sway of populist authoritarianism make it increasingly hard for Turkey’s authors and artists to tell their stories freely. One thing I’ve learned ever since I left Istanbul is that we do not forget the places we love. Bettany Hughes’s “Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities” is a brilliant and beautifully written urban biography. The 19th century Italian traveler Edmondo de Amicis’ iconic work “Constantinople” is one of the best sources for anyone interested in the cosmopolitan heritage of Istanbul.

In a bombing campaign, Turkey targeted the camps of Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria, inflicting damage on shelters, ammunition depots and bases. That’s hardly a surprise: For a long time, the Western world has turned a blind eye to Turkey’s heavy-handed treatment of the Kurds. Across decades, the Turkish state has persecuted the Kurdish minority — about 18 percent of the population — with devastating zeal. Turkey’s treatment of the Kurds is now center stage — but not because allies have woken up to the injustice of Kurds’ systematic oppression. Instead, it’s because Turkey is effectively threatening to block the admittance of Finland and Sweden to NATO unless they agree to crack down on Kurdish militants. For President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, seeing an opportunity to further cement his nationalist agenda, it’s a bold gambit. For Turkey, it underlines once again the vigor with which Mr. Erdogan is keen to stamp out the Kurds while asserting the country as a regional power. And Turkey, a member since 1952, proves it. Turkey’s conflict with the Kurds goes back at least to the late 19th century, when Ottoman centralization led to tribal uprisings. The initial two decades of the Turkish Republic, founded in 1923, involved the denial of Kurdish identity, autonomy and language, all of which were mainstays of the Ottoman Empire. The organization is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union — and its methods are indeed violent. Yet Turkey’s militaristic approach to the Kurdish issue has left little room for other, more conciliatory Kurdish organizations."

Mr. Erdogan landed in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah on Thursday night and met soon after with King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, according to images published by Turkish state news media. None of the leaders made public comments in Saudi Arabia, but speaking to reporters before departing for Saudi Arabia, Mr. Erdogan said the trip was part of Turkey’s efforts to promote peace, dialogue and diplomacy in the region. Turkey this month granted a Saudi request to transfer the trial in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi to Saudi Arabia, a move that shut down the last case that rights activists hoped would further clarify how the murder took place. He was killed in 2018 by Saudi agents inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and the transfer of the trial was most likely a prerequisite for Mr. Erdogan’s visit."

The Turkish decision on Thursday was a blow to human rights advocates who had hoped this trial would at least make public more evidence of who was involved and how Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by a Saudi hit squad in 2018 inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, where he had gone to get paperwork he needed to marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. “Let’s protect the dignity and honor of the Turkish nation, and let’s not make such a decision.” Mr. Ceylan reminded the court that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other Turkish officials had said that justice did not exist in Saudi Arabia. A panel of judges granted a request last week by the prosecutor in the trial to transfer the case because none of the 26 Saudi suspects were in Turkish custody. The transfer had been requested by Saudi Arabia in March, and Turkey’s justice minister endorsed the prosecutor’s request. Gokmen Baspinar, another lawyer for Ms. Cengiz, told the court that Saudi Arabia’s trial of suspects in the case was already over and that many of the defendants in the Turkish trial had been acquitted there. “It would be irresponsible for the Turkish nation to transfer the case to a country with no justice,” Mr. Baspinar said."

Today they make up the vast majority of the population of Armenia, a small, landlocked nation that borders Turkey. Even though Turkey acknowledges that atrocities were committed against Armenians during World War I, it vehemently denies that a genocide took place. And how is that argument reinforced in Turkish society through education and law? “Turks Depopulate Towns of Armenia” Aug. “Pleas for Armenia by Germany Futile” and “Turkish Statesman Denounces Atrocities” Oct. “Aid for Armenians Blocked by Turkey” Nov. Today Turkey does not deny that thousands of Armenians were killed during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish president has referred to the genocide as “deportations” and even once said that they were “reasonable” for the period. Until 2004 The New York Times did not officially use the term “genocide” to describe what happened to the Armenians in 1915, instead using terms like “tragedy” or “Turkish massacres.” Is it enough that the Turkish president offered his condolences to Armenians? But recognizing the Armenian genocide in Turkey has at times been either illegal or dangerous.

To inspire the party faithful, Mr. Erdogan has returned again to herald one of his favorite grand ideas: to carve a canal, through Istanbul, from the Black Sea to the Marmara Sea to open a new shipping route parallel to the narrow Bosporus. Under the treaty, Turkey agreed to free passage of civilian and trade vessels but a strict control of warships, especially of outside powers, which has held the peace in the region.

Officially Iran blames the US and Israel for Assad’s collapse, but resentment at Ankara’s role is rife, ironically echoing Donald Trump’s claim that Syria has been the victim of an unfriendly takeover by Turkey. Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations questioned whether HTS would remain allies with Turkey for long. It said: “Although Turkey is only one of the main winners of Bashar al-Assad’s fall from power in the short term, Ankara can never bring a government aligned with itself to power in Syria. Even if Tahrir al-Sham attempts to form a stable government in Syria, which is impossible, in the medium term, it will become a major threat to Turkey, which shares an 830-kilometre border with Syria.” The former Iranian president Hassan Rouhani predicted a bleak future for Syria and Turkey. “In recent weeks, all of Syria’s military power has been destroyed by Israel, and unfortunately, the militants and Turkey did not respond appropriately to Israel. Mohsen Baharvand, a former Iranian ambassador to the UK, suggested the Damascus government may find itself overly reliant on Turkey. “If the central government of Syria tries to consolidate its authority and sovereignty through military intervention and assistance from foreign countries – including Turkey – Syria, or key parts of it, will be occupied by Turkey, and Turkey will enter a quagmire from which it will incur heavy human and economic costs.” He predicted tensions between Turkey and HTS in particular about how to handle the Syrian Kurdish demand in north-east Syria for a form of autonomy. The Turkish-funded Syrian National Army is reportedly ready to mount an offensive against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces in Kobani, a Kurdish-majority Syrian town on the northern border with Turkey. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said on Wednesday that if the issue were addressed “properly” Ankara would not seek a military intervention."

Through ceasefires and frozen frontlines brokered since 2019, Turkey ensured that the rebels had the stability to rearm and reorganise. The effects of Turkey’s success will likely be felt in neighbouring Iraq. Turkey has long maintained a presence in the northern regions and has collaborated with Iraqi Kurds and targeted the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The rise of a Sunni-led government in Syria strengthens Turkey’s hand in Sunni-majority areas of Iraq that have been dominated by Iranian-backed Shia militias since the fall of Islamic State in 2019. Turkey’s ambitions extend far beyond Syria and Iraq, reaching across Africa, the Caucasus and central Asia. Four days after the rebel victory in Syria, Erdoğan successfully mediated a deal between Somalia and Ethiopia, two close Turkish allies, to de-escalate tensions over territorial disputes. Turkey’s deep involvement in Libya, including military support for the UN-recognised government, also secures its influence over the Mediterranean’s energy dynamics and positions it as a key power broker in north Africa. Ankara’s role in Afghanistan has also grown in recent years, where it has cultivated ties with the Taliban since its return to power in 2021, east of Iran’s borders. Additionally, Turkey solidified its presence in Azerbaijan near Iran’s northern border by backing Baku militarily and diplomatically during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war against Armenia, positioning itself as a key player in the Caucasus."

It was a moment preceded days before by the arrival in the Syrian capital of Turkey’s spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin. Dareen Khalifa of the non-profit International Crisis Group describes Kalin’s visit to the Syrian capital as “a victory lap,” with Ankara emerging as a major beneficiary from the new government in Damascus. The toppling of Assad has vindicated Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s approach on Syria at home in Turkey, granted Ankara new opportunities in a power struggle across Kurdish areas in the north-east and afforded it fresh influence as Syria rebuilds. “Relations between HTS and Turkey shouldn’t be overestimated, it’s not a proxy relationship, but Turkey was smart to wait until things were settled and then go in full force with Kalin’s visit and other senior people as well,” says Khalifa. Ankara had for months stalled HTS and delayed the launch of the group’s offensive, analysts said, and instead attempted to use a meeting with Russian and Iranian officials in early November in the hope of finally bringing Assad to the negotiating table. Turkey appealed to Assad’s Russian allies, Khalifa believes, asking Moscow to speak to the Syrian leader and stop the strikes, with little result. By the time Sharaa, who was formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, approached Ankara later in November, notifying them that his forces were ready to launch an offensive, they relented because of Moscow’s inability to stop Assad. “Ultimately Turkey said OK, teach them a lesson, but Ankara didn’t realise that HTS would seize Aleppo, let alone the entire country,” Khalifa says. Ankara knew what kind of manoeuvre that HTS might pull, that they would give the impression they were going in one direction, east, when actually they wanted to go south."

As the Islamists advanced south, Turkish proxies attacked US-backed Kurds along the northern border where Erdoğan, like Netanyahu, is building a buffer zone. It’s plain Turkey wants a bigger chunk of post-Assad Syrian territory – even if that means sabotaging the Kurds’ policing of detention camps housing defeated IS caliphate terrorists. “Those governments with ties to HTS should urge it to bring as wide a range of voices as possible into government and to tread an inclusive line,” the ICG urged, referring to the Gulf states and Turkey, meeting in Jordan this weekend."

The SDF commander, Gen Mazloum Abdi, said US mediation had helped broker a ceasefire agreement in Manbij, but that his forces “continue to resist and stop the growing attacks from the west of the Euphrates”, as Turkish-backed rebel groups attempted to take control of the town. Turkey, which regards the SDF and associated Kurdish fighters as terrorist groups, has also launched attacks on Kurdish troops. Ankara-backed forces struck a Kurdish convoy that it said was carrying heavy weapons looted from Syrian government arsenals. The SDF said its forces were “repelling an attack” by Turkish-aligned forces at the Tishreen dam, near Manbij. “Fierce clashes continue amid fears for the dam,” it said, blaming bombardment by Turkish warplanes and tanks. Abdi told Sky news that his forces had been forced to pause the fighting against IS in eastern Syria due to mounting attacks by Turkish forces, prompting fears of an escape or prison break by jihadist militants held in camps in the east of the country. Speaking before his departure to Turkey on a stop in Jordan, US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Thursday acknowledged “real and clear interests” by Turkey about the PKK, the Kurdish fighters that Ankara links to the SDF. Blinken later told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that Syrian civilians need to be protected, during a meeting at Ankara airport, according to the state department. The non-profit organisation also warned of widespread ill-treatment by Turkish-backed rebel groups in the area, including unlawful detentions, sexual violence and torture, land theft and extortion."

While the Assad regime has collapsed after the fall of Damascus, Turkey has sought to exploit the instability across Syria by attacking Kurdish forces who have been aligned with the US and UK in the fight against IS for a decade. The deteriorating situation in Syria’s north-east has prompted public and private warnings from the US to Turkey, while other western intelligence officials also emphasise the importance of maintaining Kurdish control. On Tuesday, John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, voiced concern that the continuing offensive by the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) could affect the anti-Islamist mission led by Kurdish groups and their military, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Kirby said the Turkish-backed operations were problematic “because it does have that risk of pulling the SDF away from the counter-ISIS mission, which we don’t want to see happen. And those are conversations that we’re having with the Turks as well.” The camps, the large al-Hawl, and the smaller Roj, where Begum lives, are a long way from the current frontlines, though both Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Israel have conducted air and drone strikes in Kurdish territory. Matt Broomfield, a specialist Syria researcher, said: “The main threat to the security of the camps would come if the SDF was forced to withdraw from the camps and detention centres because of the advance of Turkish-backed groups, or if there was a Turkish takeover.” Earlier this week, the Turkish-backed SNA seized control of Manbij, west of the Euphrates, previously controlled by the Kurdish military for eight years, with the help of air and drone strikes from the Turkish air force. The SNA is now advancing towards Kobane, near the Turkish border, the site of a significant battle in 2014, where a combination of Kurdish fighters and western air power helped oust IS in one of the first successful collaborations in the five-year war against the Islamist terror group."

Earlier this year, Assad had refused to speak to Turkey so long as Turkish forces remained in Syria. With Assad’s 24-year grip on power faltering, the Syrian leader will have no option but to make concessions to Turkey on the Kurdish issue. Ankara is convinced that the Syrian YPG, fighting under the flag of the Syrian Democratic Forces and backed by the US, is the same as the Turkish Kurdish group, the PKK. But there is no guarantee that Turkey can control the Islamist HTS, or simply order the group to end an offensive that has proved far more effective than even the HTS expected. Turkey, Russia and Iran took hold of the Syrian peace talks in 2017 through the Astana Process, but the outcome of their 21 meetings has been a political deadlock and divided country in which different factions held sway in different areas, until two weeks ago. Expectations of the Doha tripartite meeting had been low partly because Turkey has made it clear it is happy to see the mix of rebel, Islamist and pro-Turkish groups march on to the Syrian capital, Damascus, while Iran and Russia regards the HTS as terrorists. In a flurry of diplomatic meetings before the Doha summit, the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, was unable to convince Turkey that it is helping to create a dangerous power vacuum that will be filled by terrorists. Turkey will ignore Iranian accusations of a betrayal, but is under pressure to explain its future vision for Syria, and whether it also regards HTS as a viable Syrian national leadership. Ankara craves political stability inside Syria since the 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey will not return to their former homes unless Assad is crushed."

But UN decision-making is a consensus process and Turkey has reasserted its bid in recent days. Turkish media reported that the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had told the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, during a side meeting during the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro that his country would not withdraw its candidacy. Turkish officials have also been quoted saying it should be preferred in part because unlike Australia it was not a major fossil fuel exporter."

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/05/fethullah-gulen-obituary,Fethullah Gülen obituary,5 Nov 2024 18.18 CET,"Imam who sponsored dialogue between Christians and Muslims but was accused of terrorism by the president of Turkey In 1962, a 21-year-old imam, Fethullah Gülen, arrived in the southern Turkish port of Iskenderun to finish his military service. This was the heyday of secular Turkey, and he quickly ran into difficulties from a secularist commanding officer who, seeing his sermons as a threat to the republic, ordered that he should be detained for two weeks. This was perhaps the moment when the career pursued by Gülen, who has died aged 83, began to deviate sharply from that of most Turkish imams. However, this trajectory would end in mortal conflict with the Turkish state, with Gülen accused of terrorism by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and tens of thousands of his followers in jail, stripped of assets or in exile. In Turkey, among many Turks other than his own following, Gülen was a deeply sinister figure whose efforts to capture the state culminated in 2016 in a botched military coup in which more than 200 people died. One of eight children, Gülen was born in the village of Korucuk in north-eastern Turkey at a time of severe wartime hardship. In 1959, Gülen received his icazetname (Islamic studies diploma) as a preacher, making him an official of Turkey’s presidency of religious affairs, a state Sunni organisation, which posted him to a mosque in Edirne. In 1971 he suffered a severe setback when the military threw out Turkey’s civilian government and he was arrested and imprisoned for seven months. Even though he publicly supported Turkey’s 1980 military coup because it crushed communism and opened the way to religious education, he lived under cover for six years because some in the pro-military establishment saw him as an Islamist. “You could say I was protected by high friends in Ankara,” he told the Turkish journalist Mehmet Ali Birand in 1998. After a tipoff during a pilgrimage to Mecca, he returned to Turkey by hiring a smuggler to take him over the mountains, minefields and barbed wire of the Syrian border. His rise was assisted by the steady growth in the numbers of Turkish students studying in Islamic vocational schools, partly as a result of moves by the military after the 1980 coup to stem the growth of leftist movements by encouraging religious education."

Their three-day odyssey had a single goal: to get to the three-storey, Ottoman-style building on Apostolou Pavlou Street in the Greek port city where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish republic, was born and spent his early years. Few places are as indicative of Atatürk’s enduring appeal as the pink-walled abode where Turkey’s first president is thought to have been born in the spring of 1881. This year alone, nearly half a million visitors – the vast majority from Turkey – are expected to make the pilgrimage to Thessaloniki with the sole purpose of visiting the place that the legendary leader first called home. “Since January around 430,000 people have visited the house,” said an official at the Turkish consulate general, which shares grounds with the museum and oversees its daily management. “There are days when up to 6,000 visitors arrive, many on special tours in buses from Turkey, and the queues are very big.” “We love him,” said another visitor, Cansu Gigdem, who trained as an opera singer in Ankara, cupping her hands in a gesture of gratitude. “No figure is more iconic for secular Turks than Atatürk,” said Kostas Ifantis, a professor of international relations at Panteion University in Athens, referring to his programme of reforms that turned Turkey into a western-facing secular republic. How the house came to be given to the leader barely more than a decade after the Turkish republic’s foundation following the 1919-22 Greco-Turkish war is testimony to a rare period of rapprochement between the two rivals and the visionary policies of the former field marshal, then still known as Mustafa Kemal, and his Greek counterpart, Eleftherios Venizelos. In 1930 a Greek-Turkish friendship agreement was signed in Ankara by the two men; four years later, Venizelos proposed that Kemal be awarded the Nobel peace prize. It was in the spirit of détente that the municipality of Thessaloniki gave the house to the Turkish state in 1935."

The castles were supposed to bring a welcome injection of Gulf money to this part of Turkey. On paper, it was a tempting pitch for prospective purchasers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain: a luxury development named Burj Al Babas (a nonsensical mashup of Arabic and Turkish, playing on the name of local hot springs). Then there was the location: a lush spot away from the intense 45C heat of Gulf summers, conveniently located between Istanbul and the capital Ankara, and only a short distance from Mudurnu’s peaceful town square and quiet streets of squat, Ottoman-era wooden houses. As the scandal has dragged on, it has sparked multiple lawsuits, one attempted suicide, a bitter vendetta between one contractor and the Sarot Group, and even a minor diplomatic incident between Turkey and Kuwait. The deserted castles have come to symbolise the financial problems and mismanagement that have dominated Turkey’s construction sector during president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s two decades in power. Alfahhad had contemplated buying property in Turkey before, but the idea of a holiday home in a castle, or at least something resembling one, was just too good to ignore. Where others dismissed them as kitsch, Alfahhad saw in the pointed turrets references to Istanbul’s Galata Tower and the Maiden’s Tower, both of which date back centuries. Even though the chateaux were close together, he felt they were perfect for someone like him who longed for the isolation of the temperate Turkish countryside. Mudurnu, like much of Turkey, is trying to weather high unemployment and an economic crisis that in recent years has seen Erdoğan turn to the Gulf, notably the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, for a bailout. The country is dotted with a string of failed efforts to attract Gulf money, including an abandoned dinosaur park in Ankara that cost $801m, according to the capital’s mayor, who has criticised his predecessor for greenlighting it."

On Wednesday, Turkey’s air force carried out strikes against similar targets in northern Syria and northern Iraq, hours after Turkish government officials blamed the PKK for the deadly attack at the headquarters of the aerospace and defence company Tusaş near Ankara.

Since the failed coup, his movement has been systematically dismantled in Turkey and its influence has declined internationally. Known to his supporters as Hodjaefendi, or respected teacher, Gülen was born in a village in the eastern Turkish province of Erzurum in 1941. This influence also spread beyond Turkey’s borders to the Turkic republics of central Asia, the Balkans, Africa and the west through a network of schools. The Turkish government said its actions were justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by the coup. Gülen also became an isolated figure within Turkey, reviled by Erdoğan’s supporters and shunned by the opposition, which regarded his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the republic.

And in the years that followed, prosecutors allege, the airlines provided Adams and members of his inner circle more than $100,000 worth of free or discounted airfares to India, France, China, Hungary, Ghana and Turkey, where the borough president enjoyed free dinners, a boat tour of the Princes’ Islands in the Sea of Marmara and a Turkish bath at a seaside hotel, among other perks."

In an indictment unsealed on Thursday morning, the US attorney of New York’s southern district alleged that government officials and business leaders with ties to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, showered Adams with thousands in illegal foreign campaign donations and free or heavily discounted luxury hotel stays and flights around the world. In exchange, the indictment claims, Adams executed various favors for the Turkish government, including pressuring a local fire official to bypass safety regulations and greenlight the opening of a consular building, so it could be ready before a visit by Erdoğan. After that alleged intervention, a Turkish government official messaged the soon-to-be mayor calling him “a true friend of Turkey”, according to an exchange cited in the legal filing. Adams allegedly responded by calling the Turkish official “my brother”, Turkey’s ministry of foreign affairs did not respond to requests for comment. This case focuses almost exclusively on Adams’s longstanding ties to Turkish government and business officials, a relationship that prosecutors say goes back as far as 2015 when the then borough president of Brooklyn twice visited Turkey as part of a trip arranged by government officials there. Over the next three years, Adams visited Turkey again as well as France, Sri Lanka and China, accepting free business class tickets from Turkish Airlines that were worth more than $35,000 as part of an influence campaign organized by a Turkish government official, prosecutors assert. In 2018, a Turkish entrepreneur, who helped arrange one of Adams’s early trips to Turkey, texted with his liaison about giving Adams an illegal donation through a straw donor with US citizenship, according to the indictment: “We’ll make the donation through an American citizen in the US … A Turk … I’ll give cash to him in Turkey … Or I’ll send it to an American … He will make a donation to you.” Later that year, Adams met with a wealthy Turkish businessman who owned a Turkish university."

Most are pale white Akbaş dogs or Kangal shepherds, with their distinctive dark muzzle, pale golden coat and large bodies designed to herd livestock, although on the streets of Istanbul they are more commonly found lazing outside coffee shops, rotund and docile from a lifetime of treats. One particularly large and sleepy example that dozes outside an ice-cream shop on Istanbul’s main shopping street has become a local celebrity nicknamed “The Boulder”, complete with a string of rave reviews left by delighted tourists. The dog is marked as an Istanbul tourist attraction on Google Maps, which features a recommendation to avoid petting him. Despite their welcome presence on the streets in some parts, Turkey’s estimated 4 million stray dogs have become the focus of a furious national debate. In late July, Turkish lawmakers worked overnight to push through a last-minute bill they claimed would resolve the issue of stray dogs, quickly sowing the seeds of outrage among opposition groups and animal rights activists. The new law, called the “massacre law” by its opponents, requires already underfunded and crowded Turkish shelters to take in strays to be vaccinated, spayed or neutered before putting them up for adoption, adding that any that are ill or pose a risk to humans will be euthanised. The new law quickly proved just as divisive as the dogs’ presence, pitting Turks who view their country as a nation of animal lovers where street strays are treated well, against supporters of the state, who say decisive action is needed for public safety. At a protest in Istanbul, where police quickly surrounded demonstrators to assess whether their placards met their approval, a large crowd chanted “get your hands off our animals”. “This is about much more than an animal rights issue … this is a war between the Turkish government and the oppressed,” she said, concerned that the authorities could seek to remove other minority groups from public life if this new law went unchallenged. Others said they were focused entirely on the dogs, as they waved approved placards showing puppies alongside Turkish flags."

While Eygi’s family called on US officials to do more, her killing has spurred a widening rift between Turkey and the Israeli government, further inflaming tensions as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, condemned Eygi’s killing and pledged to make Israel “account for its crimes against humanity before the law”. Announcing the repatriation of Eygi’s body, Turkey’s foreign ministry said: “We will make every effort to ensure that this crime does not go unpunished.” The Turkish president also announced a halt to much of the estimated £5.3bn in annual exports to Israel last May after years of improvements in the relationship, much of them signalled through trade. A month later, Erdoğan told a meeting of his Justice and Development party officials in his family home town of Rize that Turkey could intervene “so that Israel can’t do these ridiculous things to Palestine”, without suggesting what form this might take. The president’s fiery stance has only drawn Ankara closer to countries that were previously regional foes. This month, the foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, addressed the Arab League in Cairo, the first time a Turkish official has done so in more than a decade. In August, Turkey formally applied to support South Africa’s case against Israel at the international court of justice in The Hague, which accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and calls on Israeli forces to immediately cease fighting in the Palestinian territory."

Ekinci, whose work focuses on the plight of Kurdish people in Turkey, has been charged with creating terrorist propaganda in relation to his book Rüyası Bölünenler (Dream Divided). He was charged under Article 7 of Turkey’s Anti-Terror Law No 3713, which is “routinely used to silence independent voices”, said PEN International on Monday. The first hearing in the case will take place at the 23rd high criminal court in Istanbul on 18 September. This is one of two cases related to Ekinci’s Dream Divided; a separate case saw an Istanbul court ban the publication, distribution and sale of the book in March 2023, and copies were confiscated. That case is pending before Turkey’s constitutional court. Dream Divided – published in 2014 and not yet available in English – tells the story of a Kurdish man who flees Turkey on political grounds and struggles to make a new life in Germany. Ekinci was born in 1979 in Batman, Turkey. He was charged over eight tweets published on his X account, “none of which promoted or incited violence”, according to PEN International, which has called on Turkish authorities to overturn the conviction. The cases against Ekinci are part of a “mounting crackdown” on books and social media content in Turkey, said PEN International, which urged authorities to stop “censoring and persecuting writers for the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression”."

Egypt and Turkey fell out in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab spring, primarily because of the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s coup against his Islamist predecessor Mohamed Morsi, an ally of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Nearly three years of rapprochement culminated last week with Sisi travelling to Ankara to meet Erdoğan. Turkey has supported the regime in Libya’s west, sending equipment and troops in 2019 when it looked as if Tripoli would fall to an attack being mounted by the authoritarian warlord Khalifa Haftar. At last Wednesday’s meeting in Ankara, Sisi and Erdoğan agreed to turn the page on Libya, but the practical implications of such a bold goal were left vague. He fled to self-imposed exile in Turkey, saying he feared for his life after his removal by political bodies linked to supporters of the Tripoli-based government headed by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah. In a sign of the importance of Libya to Turkey’s future relations with Egypt, the Turkish head of intelligence, Ibrahim Kalin, flew to Tripoli immediately after the Erdoğan-Sisi summit. Alia Brahimi, a journalist and specialist in the politics of the Middle East and north Africa, says in a forthcoming piece in Atlantic Council that the disputes inside Libya are between elite families over economic resources and this changes the equation for Turkey, or at least makes the calculations different from in 2019. She also points to growing financial partnership between Turkish and Libyan businesses in the country’s east, for instance the construction of the largest steel and iron production plant in the world in Benghazi, to say it is not predestined that Turkey would once more extend carte blanche military support to the government in Tripoli. At the same time, western Libya has given Turkish troops near-total immunity in a memorandum of understanding, so it would be a large sacrifice to abandon Dbeibah’s quest to control the central bank"

Detectives are focusing on a sliver of north-east London, backdrop to a decades-old dispute between two rival Turkish and Kurdish gangs: the Hackney-based Bombacilar and the Tottenham Turks. But in an investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and the Observer, experts and police sources say that the bloodshed of the past few months marks a fresh chapter in the Turkish heroin trade. Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency, confirmed it is supporting countries investigating incidents involving Turkish organised crime and said the recent shootings came amid growing violence among criminal groups that was spilling into public places. They need answers that even the highest ranks of the Hackney Bombacilar and the Tottenham Turks might not know. A Spanish police investigator who has specialised for two decades in fighting heroin trafficking described what was happening as a “war between clans” and, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Turkish gangs were the “masters of heroin in Europe”. In May Europol announced that Italian police had led an investigation resulting in the arrest of 17 Turkish nationals involved in murders across Europe. Last year six members of an Istanbul-based Turkish gang were found dead in Greece, reportedly in revenge for the killing of a rival gang boss in Paris. Mahmut Cengiz, a Turkish associate professor with the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center, and expert in the Turkish underworld, predicts the body count will rise. Cengiz confirmed Turkish gangs have already expanded their operations, diversifying from heroin to cocaine trafficking. “Recently, significant amounts of cocaine have been imported into Turkey from Latin America, facilitated by collaborations between Turkish criminal groups in Europe and within Turkey itself,” he said. The bloodied body on the Barcelona ­pavement on 4 May was that of Ilmettin Aytekin, a Turkish ­citizen also known as Tekin Kartal. The Spanish police source said they suspect Kartal was a major Turkish mafia boss. One of the diners at the Diagonal Mar restaurant was an elderly man in a wheelchair – a figure known instantly to anyone who has investigated the Turkish mafia."

The food fight began in April when Turkey applied to register the name doner as its “guaranteed traditional speciality” across Europe, meaning the label could only be used by those conforming to designated production methods and specifications for the meat inside. If Ankara’s application is successful, only beef and lamb “horizontally sliced into cutlets with a thickness of 3-5 mm” could be sold as doner. The age of the animals of origin and the knife for slicing would also have to meet distinct specifications, as well as the spices for marinating the meat, according to the application sponsored by International Doner Federation in Istanbul, which argues that the dish is an integral part of Turkey’s “culinary heritage”. Both Turkey and Germany, with its 2.7-million-strong Turkish diaspora, stake claims to being the birthplace of the doner kebab as it is now widely consumed. The delicacy of thinly sliced meat grilled on an upright rotisserie was introduced to Germany by Turkish migrants, who topped it with chopped vegetables and slathered it with garlic or chilli sauce. Its bicultural significance touched off a spat in Germany during a state visit by the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to Istanbul in April with a doner skewer in tow. If Turkey is successful in its registration attempt, the new rules would have “catastrophic consequences for gastronomy businesses as well as consumers,” Ingrid Hartges, head of the German Hotel and Restaurant Association, told local media. New European regulations would constitute “an intervention in the German market with a tangible economic impact”, the agriculture ministry led by Cem Özdemir, a Green politician with Turkish roots, told the German edition of Politico. Although Turkey does not belong to the European Union, third countries may register products for protection in the bloc."

In the Turkish-occupied north, the milestone event was cause for joy, with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, flying in to attend a military parade and fly-past commemorating the “peace operation”. In a speech, Erdoğan called the breakaway territory, recognised only by Ankara since unilaterally declaring independence in 1983, as “the apple of our eye, a part of our soul”. He said the sunrise of 20 July “put an end to the 11-year darkness enveloping” the Turkish Cypriots, who constituted 18% of the island’s population in 1974. “The Cyprus peace operation saved Turkish Cypriots from cruelty and brought them to freedom,” he told the jubilant crowd who had gathered in Nicosia, the island’s war-split capital, despite the blistering heat. Turkey launched the amphibious invasion, code-named Attila, five days after a coup was ordered and set in motion by the military junta in Athens with the aim of annexing Cyprus to Greece. The takeover, which saw the island’s president, Archbishop Makarios III, flee the country, followed years of inter-communal violence after a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots began to unravel after the nation’s independence from Britain in 1960. Over the course of the month-long Turkish offensive thousands were left dead, missing, tortured, raped and taken prisoner. By 16 August, the invading troops had seized 37% of the island’s north with an estimated 200,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots displaced in the process. The country has not only earned the reputation as a “graveyard” for mediators but is an emotional issue that is a constant thorn in relations between Nato members Greece and Turkey.

When, at 5.20am local time (0320 BST) on Saturday, sirens wail to commemorate the start of the invasion launched by Ankara in response to the attempt by Athens and its far-right junta to unite the island with Greece, families such as the Kleitous will not only relive the events that left them, and their five children, destitute and uprooted. “It did,” his mother agrees, tearing up at the memory of how the family had got into their car and fled “with Turkish tanks and armoured carriers behind us” to the nearest British base for sanctuary. In a military operation still remembered as one of the most successful in modern times, Turkish troops seized 37% of the island’s territory, prosecuting the invasion in two phases after naval ships loaded with soldiers, tanks and heavy artillery began landing on Cyprus’s northern coast from Turkey barely 25 miles (40km) away. It was a campaign that Ankara, one of the former British colony’s three guarantor powers, claimed it had every right to make in the name of protecting the Turkish Cypriot minority, many of whom had been pushed into enclaves with the outbreak of intercommunal violence after the island’s independence in 1960. To this day Cyprus remains the EU’s sole divided state, with the breakaway Turkish Republic of Cyprus – an entity that proclaimed independence in 1983 – recognised only by Ankara. Half a century later the events of 1974, though expected to be commemorated with gusto on Saturday by the statelet’s nationalist leadership , are also a time for reflection for Turkish Cypriots desperate to end the isolation and abnormality of living in what many see as a parallel universe dominated by settlers and, increasingly, the authoritarian gaze that comes with aid from Ankara."

But fierce fighting raged almost from the beginning of the invasion between the demarcation line which separates the Turkish and Cypriot areas in Nicosia. Turkish jets swooped over the city bombing and strafing Greek positions. Greece and Turkey are this morning poised on the brink of all-out war. A 48-hour-ultimatum, which expires at noon tomorrow (Athens time, 11am BST) was conveyed yesterday to the Turkish prime minister, Mr Ecevit, by President Nixon’s special envoy, Mr Joseph Sisco. He was relaying the message, to the Turkish leaders, after intensive rounds of talks with the Greek leaders who have formulated the plan. The Turks claimed last night to have sunk three Greek ships off Paphos on the west coast of Cyprus, but Athens denied that any of its ships had entered Cypriot waters."

The salute was recently the focus of a diplomatic and sporting row, when the Turkish national football player Merih Demiral used it to celebrate scoring a goal in Turkey’s round of 16 match against Austria at the Euros earlier this month. After the summoning of Turkey’s ambassador to Berlin and Germany’s ambassador to Ankara, the European football governing body Uefa issued Demiral with a two-match ban. Protests over his ban led to calls among Turkish fans for the symbol to be used even more widely as an expression of their anger at what the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, called an “unfair and biased” reaction. “Does anybody ask why the German national jersey has an eagle, or the French jersey a rooster?” he asked reporters ahead of Turkey’s quarter-final encounter with the Netherlands in Berlin. Germany is home to an estimated 3 million ethnic Turks, who make up the country’s largest single ethnic minority and form the largest Turkish diaspora globally."

But post-independence Greco-Turkish relations, between both Athens and Ankara and even more so in Cyprus itself, began to deteriorate. One of the main problems was that memories of what had virtually been a civil war where the British recruited Turkish Cypriots and some Greek Cypriots firmly believed in their Athens-backed enosis dream, were too recent. The archbishop began to make it plain that Cyprus was too close to Turkey to make union with Greece anything more than a dangerous dream. In Ankara, the scholarly Turkish prime minister Bülent Ecevit, a former journalist and translator into Turkish of TS Eliot, had not long been in office and was anxious to show his conservative opposition that he took Turkish Cypriot security as seriously as they did. We departed for the Turkish side of the argument. Rauf Denktash, a London-trained lawyer, was the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and kept beneath his desk a spaniel that snapped at visiting feet. Denktash operated from an office near what had become known as Nicosia’s green lines (the name dated from the early 1960s, when, three years after independence and the start of intercommunal reciprocal slaughter, a British UN officer picked up his green marker and drew the lines on his map where it was hoped Greeks and Turks might learn to travel with impunity). “The BBC are reporting a Turkish armada heading for Cyprus. There couldn’t be a better time for Turkey to come here. They might just cruise up and down Cyprus’s northern coast for days on end until Athens and Ankara came to their senses and everybody went home. Even so, Cyprus had a ­sizeable Turkish Cypriot minority, and a Turkish coast only 40 miles away, much closer than Greece. And there was no bigger army than Turkey’s in all of cold war Europe. The first shots of Turkey’s Operation Attila woke us shortly after daybreak, followed by the ­surprising sight of Turkish ­paratroopers dropping from their circling transport aircraft to reinforce the Turkish Cypriot militia in the city’s northern sector."

Ahmet Başar Şen was urged to explain the gesture and take measures to prevent its further use, a ministry spokesperson said, the day after Germany’s ambassador to Turkey was summoned to the foreign ministry in Ankara as Turkey’s government accused Berlin of “xenophobia” over its criticism of the symbol associated with the Grey Wolves group. Demiral displayed the wolf salute after scoring in Turkey’s round of 16 match against Austria, which his team won 2-1. Turks make up the largest single ethnic minority in Germany – 1.54 million in addition to 1.4 million German citizens who are of Turkish descent – the largest single Turkish diaspora. The national team’s success in the Euros has triggered a rapturous response by Turks across the country. She called on the European football governing body, Uefa, to investigate and consider imposing sanctions on the Turkish team. According to reports on Thursday lunchtime in German and Turkish media, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has made a last-minute adjustment to his travel plans to allow him to fly to Berlin en route to Azerbaijan, to attend the national team’s quarter-final against the Netherlands on Saturday evening. Its founder, Alparslan Türkes, said of the salute: “The little finger symbolises the Turks, the index finger symbolises Islam, the ring – or snout – symbolises the world. It means: we will put the Turkish-Islamic stamp on the world.” Türkes founded the Nationalist Movement party, which governs Turkey with Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party. How I celebrated has something to do with my Turkish identity. We are all Turks. I’m very proud to be a Turk."

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/30/erdogan-cull-turkey-street-dogs,Erdoğan’s plan to cull Turkey’s street dogs will destroy far more than just animals,30 Jun 2024 14.00 CEST,"For centuries these strays have been looked after and respected as part of Turkish culture. When I first moved to Istanbul in 2010, knowing almost no one and grappling with an unfamiliar language, it was the local street dogs who first drew me into my new life. Greeting them each day became a ritual, and when I first went to a pet shop to buy treats, using my halting Turkish to explain that I was getting them “for dogs, but not my dogs”, the shopkeeper replied: “Ahh, for the street dogs,” as though nothing were more natural. This culture in which street animals are accepted and socialised into urban life has fascinated, enchanted and sometimes repelled visitors to Istanbul for centuries. Now the Turkish government seems intent on eradicating them with a proposed law that would round up the country’s estimated 4 million stray dogs and cull those that are not adopted within 30 days – almost certainly the vast majority. Turkey, conversely, is perhaps the only country in the world where stray animals have a legal right to inhabit the street, thanks to a 2004 law passed by Erdoğan himself. During the Ottoman era, Turks’ solicitude towards animals that shared their urban space was remarked upon in the accounts of almost every European visitor to the country. Dogs were a form of “public property”, wrote the diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who came to Istanbul in the 1550s and described water troughs and kennels set up on the street, vendors selling scraps of meat for people to feed them, and religious foundations dedicated to their maintenance to which wealthy people left bequests in their wills. “How and with what justification can the inhabitants of such a country face the brotherhood of civilised nations?” wrote Abdullah Cevdet, a founding member of the radical reformist Young Turks, in a 1908 article railing against Istanbul’s dogs. In recent years there have been reports around Turkey of municipal officials knocking dogs unconscious and burying them alive, beating them to death with spades, or strangling them with their bare hands. There is evidence that Turkey’s stray-dog population has grown unsustainably in recent years, with large and sometimes dangerous groups of poorly socialised street dogs roaming the fringes of cities."

As Turkey passes its centenary, here are five of the best books to understand the country’s first 100 years. Reflecting on his childhood, Orga remembers eating melon, on ice, on a silver plate when he first heard the drums of war – those that announced, all over Istanbul, that the first world war had begun. For him and others in Turkey, nearly a decade of violence would follow. This memoir captures the founding years of the Turkish republic and the pain of those who lived through it, as Orga describes his wealthy Ottoman family’s descent into poverty and humiliation. Set in early republican Istanbul, Tanpinar’s novel was a groundbreaking satire of the politics of early Turkey – namely, the project to modernise the nation, with reforms at once liberating and overbearing. “The evening unfurled like a ribbon,” he writes, describing Istanbul’s sunsets, “whose colours ran from wine dark to golden.” Turkey’s best loved and coolest poet, Hikmet was a communist imprisoned in Turkey and exiled to Moscow, whose work was officially banned in the country of his birth for years. His poetry is known for its human scale, for the stories of everyday people told in everyday Turkish (and translated brilliantly here). Perhaps the defining change in Turkey over its second half-century can be summed up by one fact: in 1950, Istanbul’s population was around one million; today it stands at 16 million. In 2016, writer Altan was arrested and sent to prison, along with his brother and tens of thousands more – the victims of Turkey’s purges after its failed attempted coup. And so, over a period of seven months, he smuggled out handwritten notes to his lawyers, slowly putting together a memoir of his time in Silivri, Turkey’s biggest and most notorious jail. Written with a novelist’s precision, it is a testament to Turks’ enduring belief in the power of stories. The Endless Country: A Personal Journey Through Turkey’s First Hundred Years by Sami Kent is published by Picador (£20)."
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/jun/27/the-endless-country-by-sami-kent-review-turkey,The Endless Country by Sami Kent review – After Atatürk,27 Jun 2024 10.00 CEST,"Cruelty and courage in a panoramic history of Turkey The Endless Country is a resoundingly successful attempt to tell Turkey’s history – the first 100 years since the founding of the republic – through Kent’s own story of coming back to the land of his father. As a result, The Endless Country differs from many books that deal only with Turkey’s formal history, delicious food or brutal politics. He starts with his great-grandfather, reputedly the gigolo of an exiled Egyptian princess in the dying days of the Ottoman empire, who gained an education in Europe, later becoming part of the Ankara secular elite. Entwining the personal and political, Kent takes us to Yeldeğirmeni, once a cosmopolitan neighbourhood in Istanbul, where Turks, Greeks, Armenians and Jews lived together, only to be torn apart by the 1923 foundation of the republic. “This was how the Turkish nation was born,” Kent writes, “like any other birth out into the light, crying and confused, tender and pink.” Under its founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, this confused, raw nation shed its multi-ethnic character in a hurry to break with its past, turning into a mostly Turkish, almost exclusively Muslim country. Kent finds a certain cruelty in this Turkishness as the young republic learned to assert itself against often conservative uprisings. Rebellions followed, harshly put down by the fledgling Turkish state. Kent meets Hasan, a 92-year-old Alevi Kurd and a witness of the atrocities in Dersim, a prominent center of Turkey’s Alevis – a branch of Islam that differs from the mainstream Sunni faith. The Turkish state used planes and bombs to pursue the “annihilation of bandits”; at least 13,000 people died. By the 1950s, Turkey’s single-party era had ended and another unstoppable wave had begun: Islamism. As the book sails through decades and provinces, we read stories of a Kurdish Robin Hood, the obliteration of leftist movements by the state and the brutal 1980 coup that continues to shape Turkey. Kent describes today’s Turkey as a prison nation. Silivri, a once wealthy seaside town 45 miles west of Istanbul, now hosts one of the world’s biggest jails."

In a move hailed by officials in Athens as a “hugely important” admission, Zeynep Boz, the Turkish culture ministry’s top anti-smuggling official, this week said there was no evidence to prove the peer had been given a permit to strip the fifth-century BC monument of the sculptures. “Turkey is the country that would have the archived document pertaining to things that were sold legally at that time.

Korka, who wrote her PhD treatise on the ‘firman’ and spent nearly a decade sifting through archives in England and Istanbul, said the only documents she had found linked to the marbles were related to the shipments of the antiquities that Elgin had made from the port of Piraeus to England. Describing the artworks’ restoration to the place where they were designed 2,500 years ago as a “national goal”, the Greek culture minister, Lina Mendoni, said Turkey’s intervention had essentially bolstered Athens’ case. “Turkey has come out and confirmed what the Greek side has argued for years – that there was no firman.”"

Still, for the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, it seems to be a sign of cosmopolitanism to promote kebab eating, so his team thought it a good idea to send him to Turkey with a whole skewer full of meat as part of an official visit this week, the first by a German president in 10 years. Bilateral relations may be shaky but Turkey remains a highly strategic partner in the European Union’s 2016 cash-for-refugees deal (for which Steinmeier thanked Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Wednesday) despite recent reports about the deal’s unsustainability and the lack of transparency around the €6bn paid to the Turkish state for stopping refugees from fleeing towards EU territory. Turkey is also the origin country of the biggest diaspora living in Germany, comprising about 3 million people, now in second, third or fourth generations. One of them is Arif Keleş, a snack-shop owner from Berlin, who accompanied Steinmeier to Istanbul this week and served the guests at a reception directly from his rotisserie. But Steinmeier’s speech expressing gratitude for Turks introducing the “German national dish” in the 1960s, and his clumsy photo stunt with a big knife, upset many Turkish-Germans, who felt their community’s achievements had been degraded and reduced to an affordable snack. I am the daughter of small business owners of Turkish and Kurdish descent. Yes, Turkish-Germans also invented the BioNTech vaccine against Covid. Of course, like many other current and historic facts, this was not part of the friendly sandwich show Steinmeier presented during his trip to mark 100 years of diplomatic relations between Germany and the modern Turkish republic. It was ironic that Steinmeier met Erdoğan in Ankara on the same day that the Armenian genocide, which the Germans and Turks collaborated on in 1915, is traditionally commemorated. No surprise that this went unmentioned at their meeting, since the genocide is still being actively denied by the Turkish state."

With bilateral relations at a low ebb, Steinmeier said in Istanbul the döner diplomacy during his first visit as head of state was aimed at highlighting the accomplishments of Germany’s 2.7 million people who have roots in Turkey. But prominent Turkish-Germans took to social media to blast what they saw as a clumsy attempt to represent descendants of the 1960s “guest worker” programme, failing to take them seriously or treat them as equals. “And the German president brings a döner kebap maker to Turkey,” he added.

Erdoğan met Haniyeh alongside key members of his cabinet and Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister, to discuss Israeli attacks on Gaza and efforts to calm tensions across the region, according to the Turkish presidential office. Turkish relations with Israel have rapidly soured as Israel’s assault on Gaza has continued. Ankara recently opted to bar the export of 54 products including aluminium and cement to Israel until a ceasefire is achieved. A flotilla of three ships carrying hundreds of activists, journalists and aid is due to leave Turkish waters in the coming days and sail to Gaza, reprising an identical effort from 2010. In a rare interview with Turkish state media Anadolu, Haniyeh called on “our brothers in Egypt, our brothers in Turkey, our brothers in Qatar as mediators and the European countries to take action to restrain [Israeli] aggression and prevent the operation in Rafah”, as well as the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza."

In response, Turkish foreign ministry spokesperson Öncü Keçeli wrote on X: “It is the Israeli authorities who should be ashamed. Hamas has had an office in Turkey since 2011, when Turkey helped secure the agreement for the group to free Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Fidan was a past head of Turkish intelligence and the country provided information and passports to Hamas officials, including Haniyeh, according to Sinan Ciddi, a Turkey specialist at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. This has never been confirmed by Turkish authorities, however. If Qatar withdraws from mediation efforts, Turkey could seek to increase its profile based on its Hamas links. Erdoğan also met with Shoukry late on Saturday, the Turkish presidency said in a statement, where he said it was “essential for Islamic countries to work together” to “prevent the entire region from falling into a spiral of conflict”. Turkey is one of Gaza’s main humanitarian aid partners, sending 45,000 tonnes of supplies and medicine to the region. Last year, the Turkish leader likened the tactics of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to those of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and called Israel a “terrorist state” because of its offensive against Hamas after the militant group’s 7 October attacks on Israel."

Groups monitoring organised crime say Turkey is growing as a transit hub for cocaine coming from South America to Europe as security at ports such as Rotterdam in the Netherlands becomes tighter. In a report dated October last year, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said a 44% rise in cocaine seizures in Turkey between 2021 and 2022 was not reflected in data on domestic consumption, “suggesting that the country is likely to serve as a drug corridor”. The largest seizure of cocaine in Turkey – 1.1 tonnes hidden in a consignment of bananas from Ecuador – was made at the Mediterranean port of Mersin in 2021. Yerlikaya, since coming to office in June last year, has been keen to be seen to be clamping down on organised crime in Turkey to counter claims the country has become a haven for foreign gangsters.

Turkey is the number one destination. In June last year, as Love Island aired, searches for “Turkey teeth” – slang for dental veneers gained on a cosmetic holiday to the country – reportedly increased by 10,000% overnight. It came after the contestant Jess Harding described her type as a “pretty boy with Turkey teeth”. Nora Nugent, the vice-president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: “Turkish clinics advertise package deals including hotel and flights, and patients see what looks like a reasonable package. One advert from Clinichub – a company promoting itself as “your trusted health tourism agency in Turkey” – which started running in January, reads: “Transform with confidence through BBL, breast surgery, tummy tuck, rhinoplasty and more. Experience the pinnacle of service where your journey is not just a procedure, but a luxurious stay in five-star hotels, surrounded by the enchanting beauty of Istanbul.” The Clinic Hub did not provide a comment. Another post publicised in February by Dr Süleyman Özer, who advertises online as “Best Doctor Turkey”, asked consumers: “Wouldn’t you like to feel happy as well?” It continues: “With modern technology and reliable surgical methods, you can achieve the appearance you’ve always dreamed of.” The advert also includes a photograph that promotes BBLs, tummy tucks and rhinoplasty at 30% off. At least 25 British citizens have died during medical tourism trips to Turkey since January 2019, according to the Foreign Office.

For so long now, the opposition in Turkey has been demoralised, fractured and weak against an unbridled concentration of power and authority. People who wanted a secular, liberal and modern Turkey felt trapped in a cycle of lethargy, as though in a variation of Beckett’s Waiting for Godot – stuck in sameness, repetition, waiting for democracy. About 61 million Turkish citizens voted across 81 cities. Turkey’s official figure for inflation is just under 70%. The devaluation of the Turkish lira has hit businesses of all sizes and harmed living standards. As opposed to an inward-looking, navel-gazing, ultra-nationalist, ultra-religious, increasingly authoritarian and illiberal Turkey, the dream of a secular, democratic, pluralistic, inclusive and modern Turkey is still very much alive. The man at the heart of this dream is none other than Istanbul’s charismatic mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. Istanbul holds a fifth of Turkey’s population and accounts for a third of its economy; what happens in the megalopolis has massive consequences nationwide. President Erdoğan – a former mayor of the city – once said: “Whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey.” Before the local elections, Erdoğan led prayers at the Hagia Sophia – reviving an old tradition practised by Ottoman sultans before they would wage a war. It is against this backdrop that the incumbent mayor of Istanbul, İmamoğlu – Erdogan’s most significant rival – achieved the highest margin of victory in 40 years. In a moving post-election speech, İmamoğlu said to the celebrating crowds: “Starting from tomorrow, Turkey will be a different Turkey. Istanbul stands as a beacon of hope, a testament to the resilience of democratic values in the face of rising authoritarianism.” In the capital, Ankara, the CHP mayor, Mansur Yavaş, also did remarkably well, gaining 60.4% of the vote."

Social media filled with celebratory memes and people piled into cars and took to the streets across Istanbul to blare music, and in some cases tear down posters of the Istanbul mayoral candidate from Erdoğan’s party. Sunday’s local election results were the best in decades for the opposition, which won mayoral seats in Turkey’s largest cities as well as smaller rural districts in the centre of the country far from their traditional coastal base. Üsküdar, the wealthy Istanbul neighbourhood where Erdoğan has a house went to CHP, as did the eastern province of Adıyaman and several areas close to the Black Sea long considered too conservative to be in play for the opposition. “No one was expecting a success as big as this,” said Evren Balta, a professor of political science at Özyeğin University in Istanbul. Before the vote, she said: “We were talking about apathy among the opposition but it seems that supporters of the government were also disillusioned and angry at Turkish politics. While Turkish citizens suffer under the weight of high inflation and an economic crisis that has caused the value of the currency to plummet, Erdoğan won last year’s election after positioning himself as the only figure capable of solving the country’s problems, including rebuilding after the earthquakes. As a result, while his party reportedly outspent its rivals by three times in its attempt to retake Istanbul, his government was unable to offer the electorate the same bonuses it did before the presidential election, which included a raise for public servants and pensions, a month of free natural gas for the entire country and the unveiling of massive homegrown defence infrastructure. While Erdoğan put himself at the forefront of the campaign to retake Istanbul from İmamoğlu, the party selected a candidate for mayor who was unlikely to ever present himself as a potential successor, a figure that Erdoğan desperately needs but appears unwilling to anoint."

The opposition’s victory, pushing aside Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party in most of Turkey’s major cities and particularly in Istanbul, cemented Imamoğlu’s role as the primary opposition challenger to Erdoğan, who formerly held the role of Istanbul mayor decades ago and made no secret of his desire to bring Istanbul back under his control. The victory has positioned him in the eyes of many opposition supporters and analysts as the most likely challenger to Erdoğan’s presidency, amid rising suspicions the Turkish leader will seek to extend his term past 2028. The two men have plenty in common, both with roots in Turkey’s Black Sea region known for its brusque and aggressive politics, giving them a broad appeal and an ability to rile up a crowd. Both have led Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and home to about a third of its economy, and both have faced pushback from Turkey’s courts. Selim Sazak, the head of Sanda Global, an Ankara-based consultancy that advised several campaigns during the local elections, described Imamoğlu’s political brand as a blend of charisma and his Black Sea roots as “Bill Clinton from Trabzon … without the infidelity.” Despite their similarities, Erdoğan’s distaste for the Istanbul mayor transformed him from a political upstart into a rising star, when in 2019 the Turkish president demanded a re-run of the ballot from Imamoğlu’s initial win. While Imamoğlu has frequently described obstacles from Ankara stymying his ability to deliver on his promises to Istanbulites, he found success in a campaign centred on repelling Erdoğan’s bid to put the central government in the capital back in control of Istanbul, a city of 16 million people."

In a muted speech to a subdued crowd outside his party’s headquarters in Ankara, Erdoğan praised the vote itself rather than the outcome. Imamoğlu, the star of Turkey’s opposition, beat his rival, Murat Kurum, a former bureaucrat and environment minister from Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP), by a significant margin in Turkey’s largest city, where his mayorship has become a thorn in the side of the Turkish president. With a majority of votes counted, the Istanbul mayor was on course to beat Kurum by 10%. Across Istanbul, drivers honked car horns in celebration, while videos showed jubilant people tearing down a poster featuring Kurum’s face. Tens of thousands of people lit torches and waved Turkish flags after partial local election results showed that support for the government had weakened. “Turkish people have opened their eyes and voted for those candidates who think about Turkey’s economy, the youth’s education and future,” university student Ege Ersoz, 19, told AFP at the Sarachane square ."

Imamoğlu’s 2019 victory was a landmark moment for Turkey’s opposition, marking him as Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s political enemy and giving fresh hope for those seeking to challenge his rule. Erdoğan, who held the post of Istanbul mayor decades earlier, had disputed the initial vote and demanded a re-run – resulting in a bigger win for Imamoğlu second time around. The Turkish president now aims to bring the country’s largest city back under his party’s control, after fending off the most concerted challenge to his rule in decades during national elections last year when his coalition also unexpectedly won a parliamentary majority. But, she conceded as she clutched a Turkish flag, opposition voters are struggling to muster the same enthusiasm as they did five years ago. Behind him was a new tramline inaugurated by Imamoğlu, and across the waters of the Bosphorus he had a clear view of one of the Istanbul mayor’s flagship projects, a former shipyard due to become a sleek mall complex. Despite this, Tüfekçiler was unconvinced that Imamoğlu’s rule had changed much for Istanbul’s 16 million residents. “Whoever gets power can’t fix the problems in Istanbul. While Imamoğlu has become the face of Turkey’s beleaguered opposition, the sense of enthusiasm and hope for change that propelled him into office has dissipated, particularly after a six-party anti-Erdoğan coalition that united to oppose the president was defeated in elections last year and the mood among his voter base is grim. Unlike in 2019, the Istanbul mayor is running without the backing of the nationalist IYI (Good) party, leaving him to campaign alone. Only the sense that Erdoğan’s determination to retake Istanbul makes him Imamoğlu’s true opponent, rather than Kurum, is drawing some voters to the polls."

The lira rallied by as much as 1.5% to 31.91 against the dollar in response to the hike from the previous 45% rate, reversing weeks of steady declines in the Turkish currency, and Turkey’s dollar bonds extended a rally. Though inflation is expected to dip around mid-year, the recent lira slide coupled with declining foreign reserves had raised some expectations of more rate hikes ahead – though not until after municipal elections on 31 March in which Erdoğan’s AK party is hoping to win back key cities such as Istanbul. Tighter fiscal policy is expected after the elections, adding to the rising credit costs and compounding economic pain for Turks after a years-long cost of living crisis."

Initially established to prevent further fighting between the two communities in the wake of inter-ethnic hostilities in 1964, the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has been continually renewed in the almost half century since a coup aimed at union with Greece prompted Turkey to invade and seize the island’s northern third. The self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus unilaterally declared independence in 1983, although only Ankara has recognised it. Under Tatar, a self-avowed nationalist, Turkish Cypriots have hardened their stance, ruling out a peace deal that would result in the island being reunified as a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation. After meeting Holguín, the leader reiterated that the resumption of negotiations would not take place unless Turkish Cypriot sovereignty was first recognised – a condition that has been roundly rejected by the international community. Greek Cypriots, who in contrast to Turkish Cypriots rejected a UN-brokered peace plan in 2004 – shortly before the island acceded to the European Union – argue they will never accept a solution that formalises partition. In a ray of light, there were, he noted, Greek Cypriots who “are pushing” for talks to resume while a moment of rapprochement between historic Nato rivals Greece and Turkey, he said, could not be ignored."

An estimated 50,000-100,000 Kurds, including people from Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, live in Sweden. Erdoğan has previously accused historically neutral Sweden of giving sanctuary to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), despite the Scandinavian country becoming the first nation after Turkey to label it a terrorist group, a designation later adopted by the EU, UK and US. Paul T Levin, director of the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, said the political mobilisation of Kurds in Sweden in recent years has been high, which has led to associations affiliated or aligned with the PKK becoming more prominent. Last week, days after Turkey approved Sweden’s Nato application, it was announced that public broadcaster Sveriges Radio would be shutting its Kurdish newsroom – along with its Russian and Tigrinya services – on 1 April. Many Swedish Kurds are convinced it is part of a wider operation to curtail the community to appease Turkey. CK, a 35-year-old graduate student who did not want his name published, claimed asylum in Sweden after being imprisoned for nine months in Turkey accused of links to the PKK, an allegation he strongly denies. Citing the closure of the Kurdish Red Crescent in Sweden, which said in December it was winding down after its bank account was shut down, he added: “They are step by step closing institutions in the Kurdish diaspora of Sweden.’ This is 100% related to … Turkish conversation with Sweden.” “The world’s most democratic country, Sweden, has bent towards [one of] the most dictatorship countries in the world,” said Kakabaveh, who in 2022 was named by Ankara’s ambassador to Sweden as somebody he would like to see extradited to Turkey."

The destruction spanned an area almost the size of Germany, filling whole cities with mountains of rubble and causing an estimated $148.8bn in damage, according to a report from a Turkish parliamentary inquiry – almost 10% of GDP. In the immediate aftermath, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan toured the destruction and made a series of bold promises for a swift cleanup and fast reconstruction. Working in construction brought him regular employment, he said, although he complained that some companies involved in the building boom had lacked the money to pay him, as Turkey’s economic crisis rippled through the industry. Long the historic jewel and largest city in Hatay, Turkey’s southernmost province, Antakya has been emptied by the earthquakes of all but its most determined or impoverished residents. The vision for the city’s renewal, a masterplan designed by a consortium of Turkish and international architectural firms spearheaded by Britain’s Foster + Partners, offers something markedly different to Antakya’s past. Images released last year from the Turkey Design Council (TTV), a non-governmental organisation contracted by the state to oversee reconstruction plans in Antakya, which included 4,900 houses, show sleek brick and glass designs with open boulevards and imported trees – a projection of a new city that locals fear will price them out.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 7,153 migrants, paying more than €8,000 each, arrived on one of the coasts of Sicily, Puglia or Calabria from the Turkish ports of İzmir, Bodrum and Çanakkale in 2023.

The central Asian boat drivers have largely replaced Ukrainian and Russian skippers who were previously recruited by the Turkish smuggling gangs who run the route. At least 40 people currently detained in Italian prisons, accused of aiding and abetting illegal immigration from Turkey to Italy, come from the central Asia republics, according to the report.

Turkey will get 40 new F-16s and upgrades to 79 of the jets in its existing fleet, the state department said in a news release. The US did not green light the transaction until Turkey’s instruments of ratification of Sweden’s membership had arrived in Washington, a US official said, highlighting the highly sensitive nature of the negotiations, reports Agence France-Presse. Turkey’s parliament ratified Sweden’s Nato membership on Tuesday after more than a year of delays that upset western efforts to show resolve in the face of Russia’s war on Ukraine. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan initially objected to Sweden’s Nato bid over Stockholm’s perceived acceptance of Kurdish groups that Ankara views as “terrorist” organisations. But Erdogan then turned to an unmet US pledge to deliver a batch of F-16 fighter jets that has met resistance in Congress because of Turkey’s perceived backsliding on human rights and standoffs with fellow Nato member Greece. The powerful chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Democrat Ben Cardin, said Friday he would permit the F-16 sale to Turkey. “My approval of Turkey’s request to purchase F-16 aircrafts has been contingent on Turkish approval of Sweden’s Nato membership. US secretary of state Antony Blinken led an intense diplomatic effort to broker the deal, telling the Turkish president three times during a trip to Ankara just after the February 2023 earthquake that there would be no planes if Turkey blocked Sweden’s Nato bid, the US official said. US officials do not expect the Congress to block either sale, despite criticism of Turkey by some members. Athens meanwhile strongly opposed the sale due to unresolved territorial disputes with Turkey in the energy-rich Mediterranean region. The US agreement with Turkey hinged first on Athens not obstructing the sale, and Greece was simultaneously granted more advanced F-35s."

Hungary – which, unlike most other Nato countries, continues to maintain a friendly relationship with Russia – has, along with Turkey, dragged out Sweden’s Nato ratification process. With Tuesday’s vote in the Turkish parliament, Ankara’s portion of the process is nearly complete – though the first diplomat cautioned that it was “not a done deal” as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, needed to sign the ratification. Ankara and Budapest had earlier also delayed Finland’s Nato accession, but Hungary’s parliament moved quickly to ratify the Finnish bid in March last year once it became clear that a vote in the Turkish parliament was imminent. Officials familiar with talks within Nato headquarters say that unlike Turkey, Hungary never formally made any concrete demands when it came to Swedish membership.

As a result, in June 2022, the three countries signed a joint memorandum outlining steps they would take to address Ankara’s qualms, and in return Turkey said it would support inviting Sweden and Finland to become Nato members. But while most Nato countries quickly ratified Sweden and Finland’s membership, Turkey and Hungary dragged out the process. Turkey’s leadership has used the accession as a negotiating chip, including in its quest to get approval to buy American F-16 fighter jets. On Tuesday, Turkey’s parliament finally voted in favour of Swedish membership, and Erdoğan is expected to sign the legislation in the coming days. Unlike Ankara, which held highly structured negotiations with Finland and Sweden, Budapest has not made any concrete demands. Reacting to the vote in Turkey’s parliament, the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said: “Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of Nato,” adding that it was “positive” that the parliament had signed off. A second senior European diplomat said that “after good news from Ankara, all attention goes to Budapest”."

Three months after Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, submitted a bill on approving membership to parliament, MPs voted in favour of ratifying it late on Tuesday night. Tobias Billström, Sweden’s foreign minister, said the vote was “of course good”, but that the government was now waiting for the Turkish president to sign the ratification and send it on. “Of course we are not finished with the process until it has happened, on the Turkish side,” he told Swedish broadcaster SVT. Turkey’s approval leaves Hungary as the only country still to ratify Swedish membership. The outgoing Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, congratulated Sweden, writing on X, formerly Twitter, in Swedish: “I am very glad of the Turkish parliament’s vote to ratify Sweden’s Nato membership. Turkey and Hungary, both of whom maintain better relations with Russia than other members of the organisation, raised objections, holding up a process that requires unanimity among Nato’s member countries. Finland finally joined last year but Ankara pressed Stockholm to toughen its stance on members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) based in Sweden, which the US and the EU as well as Turkey deem a terrorist group. Paul Levin, the director of the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, said Sweden’s Nato membership would be very significant for the Nordic country. “Orbán has promised not to delay the process, so Turkish ratification should mean Swedish Nato accession. EU accession in 1995 meant the end of neutrality for Sweden.”"

Israel’s defence minister accused Turkey on Monday of serving as a “de facto executive arm of Hamas” after Jehezkel’s police detention. In a post on X, Yoav Gallant reminded Turkey of Israel’s swift assistance to it after last year’s earthquake and called Jehezkel’s treatment “a manifestation of hypocrisy and ingratitude”. Since the start of the conflict, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, a traditional supporter of the Palestinian cause, has repeatedly described Israel as a “terrorist state”, insisting Hamas is a “group of liberators”. On Sunday Turkey’s justice minister announced an investigation into Jehezkel over the bandage incident for suspected “incitement to hate”, after his club, Antalyaspor, sacked him over the matter.

Despite restoration led by the opposition-controlled Istanbul municipality, local news stories about sections of the wall collapsing are a frequent occurrence, a sign of how the city’s pre-Ottoman heritage often hides in plain sight, is allowed to wither or is obscured for political purposes. Local architects and historians grumbled when a Byzantine palace was restored – under a former Istanbul mayor loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – to emphasise its Ottoman features, and is now a museum displaying Ottoman-era crafts. Large sections of the Byzantine walls, as well as other ancient remains, dot an area of Istanbul known as its historical peninsula, now the conservative municipality of Fatih. Today, the walls symbolise a turning point in the city’s history and that of the wider region: the conquest of Istanbul by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, marking the end of the Byzantine empire. Constantinople became the capital of the Ottoman empire, renamed Istanbul, and many churches and cathedrals, including the famed Hagia Sophia, were converted into mosques. The government in Ankara has long sought to harness this symbolism. Alexander Christie-Miller, the author of the forthcoming To the City: Life and Death Along the Ancient Walls of Istanbul, pointed to a museum dedicated to the Ottoman conquest that lies close to the crumbling walls, while the site of the conquest itself has long been overlooked. “It’s ironic that there’s a completely artificial recreation of the siege, but 200 metres away from the actual scene where it happened is in a state of massive neglect – there’s obviously an element of this connected to a longstanding strain in republican Turkish history whereby the pre-Ottoman heritage is neglected,” he said. This neglect, combined with the ability to hide from public view between the double walls which run along some underserved neighbourhoods of Istanbul, has led to pockets being heavily associated with crime. It’s really a function of their size, and that Istanbul as a city has never had the capacity to really restore them,” said Christie-Miller."

The hotel’s collapse killed 24 children from Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus who had flown to Turkey to attend a students’ volleyball tournament. They and a group of parents and chaperones died in what Turkish prosecutors now say was a tragedy that could have been averted had proper safety standards been met. It was the single biggest tragedy in the history of northern Cyprus, whose self-rule is recognised only by Ankara. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, emerged politically unscathed from the disaster, winning re-election months later. He blamed the large death toll from the earthquakes, which killed more than 44,000 people in Turkey and nearly 6,000 people in Syria, on property developers who paid off local inspectors in order to use cheap building materials and illegally put up additional floors. Turkish police arrested about 200 people over allegedly poor building construction immediately after the first 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck. Erdoğan’s critics counter that most of Turkey’s main construction and real estate companies have formed close relationships with the ruling AKP party during his 21-year rule."

Yet the restaurant was bringing money into an area with the highest unemployment rate in Turkey. The man and other locals followed suit, opening restaurants, hotels and shops, and attracting people from Turkey and beyond to enjoy the tastes of Mesopotamia.

At the heart of those issues, according to media reports, was the wish of the two teams to wear T-shirts featuring the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, during the warm-up before the evening kick-off. A statement from organisers said: “We were looking forward to holding the match on time in accordance with the international soccer rules and regulations that require the sport to be presented without any slogans outside its scope, especially since this was discussed with the Turkish federation in the framework of the preparatory meetings for the match. The incident came amid a recent warming of relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visited Saudi Arabia in July amid efforts to repair diplomatic ties following the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. The cancellation of the final added to what has been a controversy-filled month for Turkish football.

Sweden’s Nato bid had been bogged down for months amid opposition from Turkey and Hungary, and recently it was further complicated after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan linked it to obtaining F-16 fighter jets from the US. Turkey and Hungary remain the only Nato members left to ratify Sweden’s bid 19 months after it applied for membership. The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, hailed the committee vote and said he counted on Turkey and Hungary to complete their ratifications “as soon as possible … Sweden’s membership will make Nato stronger”. Sweden’s foreign minister said the next step was the vote in the Turkish parliament. Erdoğan in July lifted his objections after Sweden and Finland agreed in a “trilateral memorandum” to address the Turkish government’s concerns about Kurdish activities. Nato allies have piled pressure on Turkey, with France saying the credibility of the alliance was “at stake”. In December, Erdoğan had linked Sweden’s membership to the US Congress “simultaneously” agreeing to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. He also said Nato allies including Canada should lift arms embargos imposed on Turkey. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara office director of the US German Marshall Fund thinktank, said: “Sweden’s Nato membership and F-16 sales to Turkey will be handled in coordination to some extent … because unfortunately, neither country trusts the other.” Turkey’s ageing air force has suffered from Ankara’s expulsion from the US-led F-35 joint strike fighter programme in 2019. US president Joe Biden’s administration has repeatedly promised to move forward with the $20bn F-16 sale but lawmakers have blocked it over concerns about Turkey’s alleged violations of human rights and long-running tensions with Greece. “There is no strong consensus in the parliament on Sweden’s Nato membership, nor in the US Congress on the sale of F-16s to Turkey,” Unluhisarcikli said."

The effort after Munich focused on targets in western Europe and Cyprus, but the current Hamas leadership outside Gaza is primarily based in Qatar and Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey has already warned Israel not to target Hamas officials there, and Alpher said that assassinations would be impossible in Qatar in the foreseeable future."

In 2015, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was in a tight spot: he had called snap elections and was under siege from all sides. Though the details were to remain murky, by spring 2016 it was becoming clear that threatening to turn on the tap of onward migration was an important tactic for the Turkish leadership. (Questions still remain over Russia’s role in fomenting the crisis as part of its Syria manoeuvres.) The 2015-16 border crisis would strengthen Erdoğan’s grip on power as he extracted promises from the EU – only partially met, but that did not particularly matter for short-term electoral purposes – on visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and billions of euros of financial support for Turkey’s refugee operations. However, we have seen in Libya and Turkey how the illiberal tendency of treating migration as a threat has been a key part of the game. Turkey, topping the list of global refugee hosts, can reasonably argue that it has done its “fair share” in hosting more than 3.6 million refugees, mostly from neighbouring Syria. States such as Morocco and Turkey regularly turn on and off the migratory tap to strengthen their hand in negotiations with the EU."

After a match between the Ankara team MKE Ankaragucu and Caykur Rizespor ended in a 1-1 draw in the Turkish capital thanks to a goal in stoppage time by Rizespor’s Argentinian forward Adolfo Gaich, Ankaragucu’s president, Faruk Koca, strode on to the field and punched the referee, Halil Umut Meler, in the face. Meler was taken to the referee’s room under heavy security, and Anadolu reported that Koca “felt faint after his violent action on the field”, and both were admitted to hospital in the Turkish capital. Turkey’s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said on X that Koca, a former member of parliament who represented an Ankara district for almost a decade withErdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), was receiving treatment “under the supervision of our security forces”. The Turkish daily Cumhuriyet reported that Koca along with two other suspects had been taken to Sincan prison outside Ankara. The incident prompted the indefinite suspension of all domestic Turkish football matches amid concerns about damage to its international image. We will never allow violence to take place in Turkish sports.” The head of the Turkish football federation, Mehmet Buyukeksi, despaired at the consequences of the incident after an emergency meeting. Do not devalue Turkish football any further. Let’s not disgrace Turkish football internationally, enough is enough!” Turkish football history has been peppered with violent incidents, including attacks on referees, that some commentators argue have led to a drop in attendances because fans feel unsafe. A year later, Turkish football experienced a weekend of violence when supporters of Trabzonspor ran on to the pitch and attacked an assistant referee, and officials from the Diyarbakir club Amedspor said their counterparts from Ankaragucu attacked them in the VIP stands, leading five to be hospitalised after they were beaten by the group."

Diplomats in Ankara and Athens had spent months working on the declaration. Acknowledging that there would be people in Greece and Turkey who did not want detente, he added: “I feel a historical responsibility to utilise this opportunity to bring the two states side by side, just as our borders are.” The doors to rapprochement were cautiously prised open this year when Athens sent rescue teams to Turkey within hours of the country being struck by a devastating earthquake in February and Erdoğan reacted swiftly to a deadly train crash in central Greece. The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided between Greek Cypriots in the internationally recognised republic in the south and Turkish Cypriots in the breakaway north since Ankara, responding to a coup aimed at a union with Greece, sent in troops in 1974. The failure to reunite Cyprus had been an impediment to improving Greek-Turkish ties, but Mitsotakis and Erdoğan, both keen to focus on their economies, appear determined to repair relations, and it was agreed that the volume of trade between the two countries would be doubled from $5bn to $10bn annually. Greece is enjoying a growth spurt after a decade-long debt crisis, and it is hoped that Turkey, a market of 80 million people, will become an important trading partner. Ankara also sees better relations with Greece as key to repairing strained ties with the EU and wider west. In addition to the declaration on good neighbourly relations, 15 accords were signed in Athens by Greek and Turkish cabinet ministers in a sign, analysts say, of the significance of Erdoğan’s visit. Among them was a 12-month automatic visa system that will allow Turkish nationals to visit Greek islands without applying for a visa. Illegal migration flows were also addressed in a groundbreaking accord under which Greek coastguard officials will be installed in Smyrna and members of the Turkish coastguard sent to Lesbos. Tzimitras said that mending fences with Greece underscored Turkey’s desire to pursue a policy of wider reconciliation."

In addition to the declaration on ‘good neighbourly relations’, 15 accords were signed by ministers representing Greece and Turkey in Athens today, in a sign, say analysts, of just how groundbreaking the Turkish president’s visit has been. Among them was a 12-month visa programme that would allow the growing number of Turkish tourists to visit nearby Greek islands all year round without having to apply for permits. Turkey currently hosts an estimated 4 million refugees and asylum seekers – mostly from Syria – more than any other country. Turkish citizens presently do not enjoy visa-free travel to the 27 EU countries. Ever more Turks have begun to holiday in Greece, with many heading for the Aegean islands close to the Turkish coast. Kairidis said the smaller isles without regular air or boat connections to Turkey had been included in the programme alongside more popular destinations such as Rhodes. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, arrived in Athens for the first time in six years, determined to move on with a “win-win approach” from the disputes and tensions left by his previous trip to the city.

The agreements include a deal on a 12-month visa programme that would allow the growing number of Turkish tourists to visit nearby Greek islands all year round without having to apply for permits. Pundits are of a mind that today’s visit to Greece by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been even more successful than envisaged. “I believe it will be better for the future of both sides to see the glass half full,” the Turkish leader told Greece’s head of state, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, in his first meeting of the day. Like Eleftherios Venizelos, his great uncle who oversaw détente with Turkey in the 1930s and is widely regarded as the country’s landmark 20th-century statesman, Mitsotakis wants rapprochement dearly if only because it will be good for the economy."

The last time the Turkish leader visited the Greek capital – exactly six years ago to the day – what had been billed a historic tour descended into a verbal theatre of war as Erdoğan, dispensing with diplomatic niceties, went on the offensive. From then on, bilateral ties only worsened, with the two Nato rivals nearly going to war over disputed undersea energy resources; Athens accusing its neighbour of “weaponising” migration and Ankara questioning the ownership of outlying Greek islands. “There, we will discuss both our bilateral relations and Turkey-EU relations in order to make decisions worthy of the spirit of the new era.” Erdoğan said: “Whether it’s the issues in the Aegean, joint efforts against irregular migration, ongoing problems of the Turkish minority in Greece, there is no problem that we cannot solve through dialogue based on mutual goodwill.” The dramatic fall in migration flow from Turkey in recent months has been indicative of the improvement in ties. Analysts believe better ties with Greece will also be key to repairing Turkey’s strained relationships with the European Union and other western allies. But while Turkey’s devastating earthquake in February and a deadly train crash in central Greece had gingerly edged the neighbours towards rapprochement, officials believe longstanding volatile disputes will be bypassed on Thursday. Greece and Turkey remain at odds over a host of issues including maritime boundaries, the extent of their continental shelves and airspace over the Aegean, although hostility can be traced back to the subjugation of Greeks under Ottoman rule before a bloody war of independence led to the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830. The continued division of Cyprus – invaded by Turkey in 1974 after a coup aimed at union with Greece – has remained a perennial thorn in relations. But there are mounting signs that in Ankara and Athens, officials are eager to concentrate on bilateral relations beyond the constraints imposed on both capitals by the unresolved Cyprus problem."

Erdoğan is fully aware of his leverage in Berlin: almost 3 million people in Germany are of Turkish heritage. Ankara provides close to 1,000 mosques in Germany with imams. Turkey is a vital partner in Nato’s support for Ukraine, providing drones and keeping the Black Sea open for grain exports. And Germany, most importantly, wants Turkey to control irregular migration in the Mediterranean to avoid another refugee crisis. The two leaders avoided a public falling-out in Berlin, but back in Ankara, Erdoğan told Turkish news outlets that the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was clearly in a “crusader mindset”, and that was also true for “the other one”, referring to Scholz.

A spokesperson for the Australian federal police (AFP) said it was “aware” of the reporting from Turkey and continued to work with international partners to combat transnational serious organised crime.

Forging a nation while attempting a clean break with its past can be fraught enterprise in the most favourable circumstances, but following independence Turkey’s new leaders had an especially daunting task. As the country turns 100, Turkey’s republican era is a story of its leaders working to continually redefine the country as they tend to the scars of its history, while attempting to find their nation’s place in the world. Atatürk gathered representatives at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, where he declared Turkey a republic. Atatürk envisioned Turkey as a secular republic and a home for the Muslim populations of post-Ottoman territories. A new Turkish alphabet law was passed, making the use of Latin letters compulsory in all public communications and the education system, discarding the use of the Arabic script for the Turkish language. The move erected a firewall around Turkey’s past for its citizens many of whom would no longer have access to the language in which their history was written. His close confidant, İsmet İnönü, took over before Turkey held its first free election. Adnan Menderes was elected prime minister of Turkey in the country’s first democratic election, ushering in a new era in which the country would enter the US camp during the cold war and become a member of Nato in 1952. It was the first of four military takeovers in Turkish history. He is perhaps better remembered for his decision in 1974 to send Turkish troops into Cyprus. Turkish troops pushed into Cyprus in 1974 in response to an attempt by a military government in Athens to annex the island to Greece. Turkey established the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the island’s northern regions for the Turkish Cypriot population. The state is recognised only by Ankara. Muhammad Ali visited Istanbul in October 1976 and prayed alongside the deputy prime minister, Necmettin Erbakan, at Sultan Ahmet mosque. The world heavyweight champion’s visit had an electrifying impact on the Turkish public."

The bill’s passage through parliament should be a formality, but Erdoğan has a track record of holding out on Sweden’s application to extract concessions from the US, including the sale of F-16s to Ankara – a deal that has been held up in the US Senate. The Turkish leader has also been demanding that Sweden tighten up on the extradition of Kurdish asylum seekers living in Sweden. Turkish officials have insisted the steps Sweden had taken to clamp down on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers party militia were insufficient. In a sign of real movement, the Turkish parliament on Monday moved the accession bill forward. “The protocol on Sweden’s Nato accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the grand national assembly of Turkey,” the presidency wrote on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, without elaborating. Turkey and Hungary are the only Nato members whose legislatures have yet to sign off on Sweden’s accession. The Hungarian leadership – which is closely aligned with Ankara and maintains a relationship with Moscow – has sent mixed signals about why it has dragged its feet. Most observers have assumed that Hungary has been hiding behind Turkey, and will not want to be exposed as the only Nato member blocking Sweden’s membership. The Hungarian parliament had earlier also delayed its ratification of Finland’s membership, moving quickly once it became apparent that Turkey would sign off as well.

A Turkish defence ministry official said the drone did not belong to the Turkish armed forces, but did not say whose property it was. The incident on Thursday came days after Turkey’s national intelligence agency carried out strikes in Syria against Kurdish militant targets after a bomb attack in Ankara last weekend. The Pentagon spokesperson, Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, said Turkish drones had been seen carrying out airstrikes in Hasakah, Syria on Thursday morning about 1km (0.6 miles) away from US troops. A few hours later a Turkish drone came within less than half a kilometre of US troops. “We have no indication that Turkey was intentionally targeting US forces,” Ryder told reporters. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke with his Turkish counterpart after the incident, a call Ryder said was “fruitful”. The incident comes at a delicate moment for US-Turkish relations, with the US hoping Turkey will ratify Nato membership for Sweden. While the US has not shot down a Turkish aircraft before, tensions have flared and there have been close calls. In 2019, US troops in northern Syria came under artillery fire from Turkish positions. US-allied Syrian Kurdish forces said Turkish attacks had killed eight people in an escalation prompted by the Ankara attack by Kurdish militants. US support for Kurdish forces in northern Syria has long caused tension with Turkey, which views them as a wing of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). That group claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attack in Ankara near government buildings. On Wednesday, Turkey said the two attackers had come from Syria. On Thursday, a Turkish defence ministry official said a ground operation into Syria was one option Turkey could consider. Turkey has mounted several previous incursions into northern Syria against the Syrian-Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) group. The official said: “Our only goal is to eliminate the terrorist organisations that pose a threat to Turkey. Security forces in north-eastern Syria said Turkey launched a series of attacks on Thursday with more than 15 drones entering the region’s airspace and hitting targets including oil and gas stations and infrastructure."

Earlier, two assailants detonated a bomb in front of Turkish government buildings in the heart of Ankara, in what authorities said was a terrorist attack that left both dead and two police officers wounded. Kurdish militants later claimed responsibility for the blast, which was the first in the Turkish capital since 2016 and happened less than a mile away from the parliament building on Sunday, hours before lawmakers were due to return after a three-month summer break. The same group was responsible for two bombings that struck the Turkish capital in 2016. Erdoğan also nodded towards potential changes to Turkey’s constitution in the coming parliamentary term, after an election earlier this year where his opponents warned against an increasing concentration of power around the presidency. Referring to a thwarted military coup in 2016, Erdoğan said that Turkey “deserves to crown its struggle for democracy with a civilian constitution. After the attack, authorities closed one of the Turkish capital’s main thoroughfares, which passes close to a number of state institutions including the parliament building. According to the state-run Anadolu news agency, Turkey’s criminal court of peace in Ankara issued a ban on media access and publication about the attack. Turkish authorities last year passed a sweeping new law intended to curb “disinformation”, with those accused of breaching the law threatened with up to three years in prison. The law came into force shortly before an assailant detonated a bomb on one of the busiest shopping streets in Istanbul last November, killing six people and wounding at least 81. Turkish officials blamed Kurdish militants for the attack. The attack in Ankara follows a spate across Turkey in recent years that officials largely blamed on members of the Islamic State or Kurdish militant groups. In February 2016, a bomb struck a convoy of vehicles carrying military personnel during rush hour in Ankara, killing 30 people and wounding 60. A month later, a second bomb struck a central boulevard in Ankara, killing 37 people and injuring 125. Echoing a response to previous attacks, Turkish officials rushed to condemn alleged disinformation about the latest attack in Ankara."

Turkish-led rescuers have said the operation to bring up 40-year-old Mark Dickey by stretcher could take up to four days, and will require constant monitoring of his health. “I do know that the quick response of the Turkish government to get the medical supplies that I need, in my opinion, saved my life. It would take a (healthy) person 16 hours to come out,” Cenk Yildiz, a regional official from Turkey’s disaster relief agency, told the IHA news agency. Yildiz’s comments were echoed by the Turkish caving federation, which described the formidable effort involved. The Turkish federation launched the rescue operation with the help of Turkey’s emergency response service on Tuesday, with several international teams, including Croatians and Italians, assisting. The Morca cave is Turkey’s third deepest, according to the federation, running to a depth of 1,276 metres."

For some local people, the cruise ships have become an irritating reminder of how a prime stretch of Istanbul’s coastline has been privatised. The megaproject’s ability to attract tourists and investment from Turkey’s powerful construction firms has long been touted as a success story by the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who in 2021 declared it a “worldwide project with the potential of drawing 25 million visitors, 7 million tourists, and 1.5 million cruise passengers”. Opponents cited a clause in Turkey’s constitution that says when it comes to the coasts, “public interest shall be taken into consideration with priority”, despite the authorities rezoning the area for tourism as a workaround. The Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) fought local authorities in court for almost two decades to try to halt the construction, citing environmental and other damages to the social fabric of the area. Galataport’s supporters champion the project as benefiting Istanbul financially, claiming that it has created 5,000 jobs, welcomes wealthy tourists from Mediterranean cruises, and spurs wider redevelopment of the neighbourhood. A longtime member of the local residents’ association who has lived here for most of her life, Eğinlioğlu says the project has created a blast radius of gentrification, increasing her property taxes and causing rents to rise even faster than they had been already during the recent economic crisis and rapid devaluation of Turkey’s currency, the lira. Still, the project has proven so popular with Erdoğan’s government that even the administration in Istanbul, run by the main opposition party, is considering its own version of the development. For Istanbul residents such as Elif Refiğ, who has lived near the port for almost two decades, seeing the cruise ships from her balcony and hearing the music that blasts from their top decks at night are constant reminders of how much the port development has reshaped the neighbourhood."

The warrant was secured as part of an ongoing investigation into a smuggling network involving antiquities looted from Bubon in south-western Turkey and trafficked through Manhattan, a spokesperson for the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, said. Turkey first made claims about the statue in 2012 when it released a list of nearly two dozen objects in the Cleveland museum’s collection that it said had been looted from Bubon and other locations. Museum officials said at the time that Turkey had provided no hard evidence of looting. “The enduring dispute surrounding this matter has kept him separated from his home town,” Zeynep Boz, of Turkey’s ministry of culture and tourism, said of the statue. The Manhattan district attorney’s office has worked in recent years to repatriate hundreds of objects looted from countries including Turkey, Greece, Israel and Italy."

The Alacasu and Bostanlık beaches, on Turkey’s southern Mediterranean coast in the province of Antalya, were part of Phaselis, a Greek and Roman settlement thought to be the birthplace of Plato’s student Theodectes. As sky-high inflation and a plummeting currency exacerbate an economic crisis, Turkey sees tourism as a lifeline. At Alacasu and Bostanlık, a report compiled by the Antalya branch of the Turkish Association of Archaeologists (TAA) identified “the potential to offer up significant archaeological information”. The culture ministry spent just 60,000 Turkish lira (£1,700) on archaeological research in the area in 2022, compared with more than 50m lira on construction. The Don’t Touch Phaselis campaign (Phaselis’e Dokunma Hareketi), set up by local people and supported by organisations including the TAA and World Wildlife Fund Turkey, took legal action and in June succeeded in temporarily halting construction. The group believes that if the court rules in the ministry’s favour, other projects in protected areas elsewhere in Turkey could follow. Turkey is a signatory to the Barcelona Convention, an international agreement to protect the environmental and cultural assets of the Mediterranean Sea. None of Turkey’s cultural heritage sites would be safe.” The Chamber of Architects of Turkey (CAT) lost a legal case in the capital, Ankara, to close the road after the state surveyor declared it had caused no harm. “If the government damages cultural and historical aspects of Cappadocia, it will form a foundation for other developments,” said Tezcan Karakuş Candan, the president of the Ankara architects’ chamber. “Unfortunately, Turkey’s natural and cultural heritage is being destroyed for financial gain and will be lost for future generations.” In 2020, the 12,000-year-old city of Hasankeyf in Batman, south-east Turkey, was completely flooded to make way for the Ilisu dam and hydroelectric power plant."

Samandağ is one of at least 18 locations where authorities have dumped rubble across Hatay province, after two powerful earthquakes killed more than 60,000 people in south-east Turkey and northern Syria in early February. Two months ago, a team from Turkey’s chamber of environmental engineers (CMO) analysed eight samples from dumps across Hatay, including from the pile in Samandağ, and found evidence of asbestos in all of them. In four, they were able to identify chrysotile, one of the most common forms of asbestos, banned in Turkey in 2010 but commonly used in roofing and houses built before the ban, including across the earthquake zone. Initial estimates by the UN suggested the earthquakes generated up to 210m tonnes of rubble, while Turkish officials said at least 200,000 buildings were destroyed. People in the province have long seen themselves as neglected by central government in Ankara, with help arriving later in Hatay than elsewhere after the earthquakes. Hatay’s mayor, Lütfü Savaş, blames Turkey’s disaster management agency, Afad, for the locations of the dump sites, which he says were chosen in the days immediately after the quakes. Alkan, along with other lawyers from the Hatay bar association, environmental engineers and the Turkish Medical Association, filed suit against the Hatay government, demanding an immediate halt to the dumping of rubble in residential areas, wetlands, olive groves and near camps for displaced people."

On Tuesday night, the government announced the establishment of an operational “centre of excellence” by the Turkish national police and supported by the UK. The centre would aim to strengthen collaboration between the National Crime Agency and Home Office intelligence staff based in Turkey and their Turkish counterparts, the British government said. “Today we’re announcing a new partnership with one of the most important of those allies and that’s Turkey,” said Jenrick, adding that the nation’s geopolitical position on the cusp of Europe and Asia meant it was “absolutely critical” to work with Ankara. An investigation for the Guardian revealed in June that the Home Office provided more than £3m in funding to Turkish border forces in the previous year to prevent migrants reaching the UK. The UK government said on Tuesday that it would deploy more officers in Turkey to work on joint operations. When asked by the BBC if Turkey would stop the manufacturing of boats or block those passing through, Jenrick said it was “one element” the two nations were working on. The Turkey deal comes after Jenrick’s visit last month, when the immigration minister inspected the Turkish-Bulgarian border checkpoint at Kapıkule – the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe. The reinforced collaboration between the UK and Turkey will take centre stage at the forthcoming UK-Turkey migration dialogue meeting, scheduled for the autumn in London. In addition to funding, the Home Office has in the past supplied Turkish border forces, including the national police and the coastguard, with equipment and training. Last year Turkey said it had turned back 238,448 migrants at its eastern border with Iran. Video evidence seen by the Guardian shows cases of extreme violence and force used against Afghan migrants attempting to cross the border into Turkey."

It is the first case to be brought on the issue of Turkish airstrikes against the Yazidi people. Further, the claimants allege that Turkey failed to investigate the killing of civilians resulting from the airstrikes and provide victims with effective remedies, constituting a violation of their rights to a prompt, independent and effective investigation under the same covenant. Turkey characterised the airstrikes at the time as an attempt to control the armed wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) as well as the Sinjar Resistance (YBS), a Yazidi self-defence force. The YBS denies Turkish claims that it is linked to the secular PKK. It is claimed that since 2017 about 80 Yazidis have been the victims of “collateral damage” from Turkish airstrikes against PKK targets in Iraq, where many fighters have found refuge. On 18 August 2021, the Turkish ministry of defence claimed to have neutralised 10 PKK terrorists in an air operation. Earlier that week, a Turkish airstrike targeted a vehicle in the centre of Sinjar, killing a commander and a YBS fighter and injuring three people. Aarif Abraham, the director of the Accountability Unit, said: “This is a critically important and symbolic case involving clearcut violations of the fundamental rights of Yazidi citizens by the Turkish state. “Turkey has long enjoyed impunity and the international community’s silence for targeting non-Turkish nationals outside its territories on the pretence of targeting terrorists. The human rights committee is the only body which holds the realistic prospect of holding Turkey accountable and providing the victims with meaningful redress.” Dr Leyla Ferman, the chief executive of Women for Justice, said: “After the victory over Islamic State in Sinjar, the Turkish airstrikes pose the greatest security risk. The Yazidis were shocked that Turkey did not stop at a hospital.” The UK government has urged Turkey and the Kurds in Iraq to settle their differences but has not directly condemned the airstrikes by Turkey."

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had said at the Nato summit in Vilnius that he would recommend the Turkish parliament ratify Sweden’s application, ending Turkey’s year-long veto, but on returning from a trip from the Gulf he merely said Turkish ratification was contingent on the steps taken by Sweden. Erdoğan has reconvened the Turkish parliament for an emergency August session on 25 July, suggesting he may be preparing to lift the veto on Swedish membership of Nato. “We expect promises to be fulfilled,” Erdogan added, referring to a deal struck by Turkey, Sweden and Finland last year in Madrid aimed at addressing Ankara’s concerns about Kurdish separatists’ activities in Sweden. Speaking of the Qu’ran desecration, the new Turkish justice minister, Yilmaz Tunç, called for “comprehensive investigations to identify the suspects and gather clear identity information and evidence of their criminal actions”. Turkey’s foreign ministry called on Sweden to take “dissuasive measures to prevent hate crimes against Islam and its billions of followers”. Sweden’s membership of Nato does not turn only on the country’s approach to dissidents, but on whether the US will sell F-16s to Turkey – something that depends on the assurances Turkey is willing to give the US Senate about keeping out of Greek airspace.

A small window of diplomatic opportunity may have opened due to Turkey’s recent interest in negotiating its relations with the European Union, especially on visa-free travel and the customs union. Cyprus – a former British colony – has been split since Ankara sent in troops in 1974, seizing its northern third in response to a coup orchestrated by the junta then in power in Athens aimed at uniting the country with Greece. However, the recent completion of elections in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus gives politicians greater room for manoeuvre if they wish to revive talks after a poorly prepared UN-led conference in Switerzland failed in 2017. Since then Turkey has become even more committed to a two-state solution for the island, but Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus (the self-styled “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”) is recognised only by Turkey, leaving it dependent on Ankara both economically and in terms of security. There are up to 30,000 Turkish troops on the island. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is due to visit the island on Thursday to mark the occupation and to open a new airport in the north. Some argue that Turkey’s desire to reopen talks on its relationship with the EU might give Brussels some leverage to persuade Erdoğan to re-examine a Cyprus strategy that is probably draining Ankara of badly needed funds. To Washington’s relief, Erdoğan has in principle lifted his veto on Sweden joining Nato, but appears to be waiting on confirmation from Washington that the US Senate is willing to supply F-16 jets to Turkey. He wants written undertakings that Turkey will not use the F-16s to continue overflights of Greek islands, creating an elaborate piece of choreography that affects not only Turkey, Sweden and Nato, but also Cyprus. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is due to address the EU foreign affairs council where he is likely to update EU foreign ministers on US relations with Turkey. Ersin Tatar, the elected Turkish Cypriot leader, has opposed unifying the island and wants the north of Cyprus to be recognised as an independent country."

Coinciding with Turkey’s release of Ukrainian prisoners placed in its custody by Russia and some unusually amicable exchanges between Erdoğan, the EU and Ankara’s old enemy, Greece, all the talk was of a sudden, pro-western tilt by the notoriously unbiddable Turkish leader. Within hours of giving Sweden the thumbs-up, Erdoğan warned its accession would need the approval of Turkish MPs, a possibly lengthy process. It became clear, too, that the unspoken quid pro quo is the sale to Turkey of long-coveted US F-16 jets – the same jets that are denied to Ukraine, which actually needs them. Turkey has rejected western sanctions on Moscow and boosted bilateral trade since the war began. Turkish exports almost doubled, to around $4.9bn (£3.74bn), in the first half of this year. Erdoğan said last week he was ready to help Ukraine continue grain shipments through the Black Sea, and Turkey continues to sell drones to Kyiv. Yet at the same time, Russia remains Ankara’s top supplier of natural gas. Around 6 million Russians will visit Turkey this year. Crucially for Erdoğan, superficially improved relations with the west may help him revive Turkey’s ailing, ill-managed economy."

Luxembourg – from where the then EU Commission president Jean Claude Juncker hailed – was “the equivalent of a little town in Turkey”, he taunted. In that context, holding back Turkish approval of Sweden’s membership of Nato until the eve of this week’s summit in Vilnius was to be expected. Erdoğan has been fighting for Turkish interests on three fronts: a tougher crackdown on Turkish Kurds in Sweden; lifting the de facto US Congress veto on the US sale of F-16s to Ankara; and – in a blindside late twist – demanding progress over Turkish aspirations for visa-free travel inside the EU. In all three cases he made progress without having to set a precise date by when the Turkish parliament would approve Sweden’s Nato membership. Sweden has amended its constitution, changed its laws, significantly expanded its counter-terrorism cooperation against the PKK (the Kurdish separatist group) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. Sweden has also reiterated – a word designed to show no new concession has been made – that it will not provide support to what Turkey describes as the Fethullah terrorist organization (FETO), an entity the Turkish government perceives as a clandestine network led by the preacher Fethullah Gülen. On the issue of F-16s, Turkey’s national defence minister, Yaşar Güler, spoke by phone late on Monday with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. In a glowing statement, the US defence department said the pair “lauded the long history of military cooperation between the United States and Turkey and applauded our continued close cooperation”. It continued: “They also discussed the positive talks between Turkey, Sweden and Nato secretary general [Jens] Stoltenberg, as well as the [US] Department of Defense’s support for Turkey’s military modernisation.” More importantly Bob Menendez, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee and a great friend of Greece, said he would decide within a week whether to lift his veto on the F-16s and remarked there had been a lull recently in Turkish belligerence towards Greece, and hoped this was “a permanent reality”."

Speaking at the airport before departing for the Nato summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, the Turkish president said: “First, let’s pave the way for Turkey in the European Union and then we will pave the way for Sweden just as we did for Finland.” The US president had been working on a four-country deal that would lead to Turkey allowing Sweden into Nato in return for the sale of US F-16 jets to Ankara, on the condition they are not used to threaten Greece. Erdoğan’s remarks suggest diplomats’ eve-of-summit efforts to lift the year-long Turkish veto on Sweden’s membership of Nato will be even more complex than envisaged. Turkey has been in talks over joining the EU in one form or another since 1987 but there is no enthusiasm for letting such a large country with a questionable human rights record join. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, rejected Erdoğan’s attempt to link Turkey’s EU membership aspirations to Sweden’s application to join Nato. “Sweden has taken some steps in the right direction,” Erdoğan’s office quoted the Turkish leader as telling Biden in a call on Sunday. Over the weekend, the link between Sweden’s Nato membership and the Turkish demand for the US Congress to permit the sale of F-16 jets to Turkey has become more explicit, as well as the conditions on which Congress would sanction the sale. After two hours of talks in Vilnius with the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, Erdoğan broke off discussions to meet separately with the EU council president, Charles Michel – a possible indication that EU officialdom is being drawn into his unexpected demand to revive Turkey’s accession talks. Formally, the Swedish bid to follow Finland into Nato remains linked to Erdoğan’s demand that more is done to clamp down on Kurdish activists in Sweden, including extraditing a group of Kurdish exiles seen as suspected terrorists by Ankara."

According to the agreements, these ringleaders were to remain on the territory of Turkey until the end of the conflict.” Peskov said the release was a result of heavy pressure from Turkey’s Nato allies in the run-up to next week’s summit of the military alliance at which Ukraine hopes to receive a positive sign about its future membership.

As the war entered its 500th day on Saturday, Zelenskiy hailed progress from talks in Istanbul with counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He said: “I am grateful to Turkey for its constant support of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Zelenskiy said military production agreements had been signed, including for the manufacturing of drones, and that he “invited Turkey to join the large-scale work to rebuild Ukraine, its reconstruction, and transformation”. Zelenskiy’s talks in Turkey were being watched closely by the Kremlin, which has tried to break its international isolation by cultivating strong relations with Erdoğan, who still opposes Nato membership for Sweden. But while reaffirming his longstanding call for peace negotiations, Erdoğan told reporters at a joint media appearance with Zelenskiy in Istanbul: “There is no doubt that Ukraine deserves membership of Nato.” Erdoğan said he would personally brief Vladimir Putin on the latest negotiations when the Russian president visits Turkey next month, his first trip there since the invasion.

Stoltenberg’s comments came as Zelenskiy continued a round of whistle-stop diplomacy in several European countries to argue for a firm commitment to admit Ukraine to Nato and ask for new weapons for Kyiv, ahead of a meeting with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He then flew to Bratislava, where he met the Slovak president, Zuzana Čaputová, before heading to Turkey. Turkey is blocking Sweden’s candidacy because of a longstanding dispute about Stockholm’s perceived lax attitude toward alleged Kurdish militants living in the Nordic country.

Kristersson thanked the US president for maintaining “transatlantic unity” during the upheaval sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and praised Biden’s “strong support” for Sweden’s Nato bid, which is being held up by Turkey and Hungary. After his meeting with the US president, Kristersson said that he and Biden had agreed that the “Vilnius meeting in a week is certainly appropriate time for Sweden’s entry, but only Turkey can take Turkey’s decisions.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not say whether Biden planned to reach out directly to his counterparts in Turkey and Hungary before the summit. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, however, has frustrated western leaders by linking approval for Sweden’s bid to demands that Stockholm crack down on members of opposition Kurdish movements, such as the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey says is a terrorist group. On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan rejected making the Nato summit a deadline, saying “we never approve of the use of time pressure as a method.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke to Fidan on Wednesday, encouraging Turkey to support Sweden, the state department said in a statement. “Secretary Blinken stressed the importance of Nato unity in such a critical time and encouraged Turkey’s support for Sweden to join the Nato Alliance now,” it said.

In a corner, neon lights illuminate a DJ pumping Turkish pop music to long tables of patrons increasingly loose on raki, Turkey’s aniseed-flavoured national drink. It’s a typical meyhane night – the name for a traditional restaurant where people spend hours drinking listening to music and watching bellydancing, a staple of Turkish social life for centuries. Turkey’s currency is hitting daily historic lows amid an economic crisis that continues to batter Istanbul’s nightlife industry. But those wage rises don’t extend to the waiters, DJs, dancers, club promotors and bar owners who make up Istanbul’s vibrant nightlife scene. The crisis could spell a slow death for an industry that provides not just a vital financial lifeline to Turkey’s most populous and lively city, but also an essential slice of its character, one that has long been neglected by the municipal administration and the government. Meanwhile, Turkey’s cost-of-living crisis is affecting everyone from patrons to performers and club owners. You can’t, it’s impossible,” says Tuna Öztürk, known professionally as Tuna Oz, a DJ and bartender who has worked in Istanbul’s nightlife scene for decades. Öztürk has grown used to working multiple jobs to survive, spending his days at a bar tucked into an Istanbul backstreet and his nights at neighbouring Club Banger. While Istanbul has a nominally liberal mayor from the opposition CHP, protecting nightlife has not been part of his priorities. In addition, the Beyoğlu district that forms the hub of the city’s bars and nightclubs is controlled by Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party, which has long seen nightlife as an anathema to more traditional Turkish culture, despite its long history in Istanbul."

The protest came as Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Wednesday that Sweden had made some progress, but not enough. “I condemn the vile protest in Sweden against our holy book on the first day of the blessed Eid al-Adha,” the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, tweeted on Wednesday, adding that it was “unacceptable to allow anti-Islam protests in the name of freedom of expression”. A series of protests in Sweden against Islam and in support of Kurdish rights have offended Turkey, which has held up the Nordic country’s accession process, accusing Sweden of harbouring people it considers terrorists and demanding their extradition. Nato has been pushing Turkey to give Sweden the green light before an alliance summit in Lithuania on 11-12 July. Stoltenberg said earlier this week that the Brussels talks, which will be held at the city’s Nato headquarters next Thursday, would include the foreign ministers and intelligence advisers from Turkey, Sweden and Finland.

More than a decade later, a small enclave in Idlib province in north-west Syria marks the extent of rebel control, while Turkish-allied opposition militias control other areas in the north. Turkish authorities say they seek to return refugees to areas either under Turkish control or to the area controlled by the rebel-led Syrian Salvation Government, the political arm of the militant group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham, which has been accused of rights violations. Fady and his brother belong to the estimated 5.4 million Syrian refugees living in Lebanon and Turkey, neighbouring countries that had provided a haven for Syrians fleeing persecution and a civil war that grew from a popular uprising in 2011 against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. In contrast, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, unilaterally granted millions of Syrians temporary protection in Turkey in 2014, offering them safety and accusing Assad of “state terrorism”. Now, both countries have moved to expel refugees amid efforts in the Turkish capital, Ankara, and elsewhere across the Middle East to restore diplomatic relations with Damascus to where they were prior to 2011. In Turkey, Erdoğan vowed to return 1 million of the estimated 3.6 million Syrians during an acceptance speech after a recent election victory – a nod to an upsurge in nationalist and anti-refugee sentiment.

The decision marks a partial shift in the unorthodox economic policy of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, under which interest rates have been frozen since March 2021 despite a sharp devaluation in the Turkish lira. Officially, inflation in Turkey is at 39.59%, although unofficial estimates from Turkey’s independent Inflation Research Group put it at 110%. “Today’s decision is insufficient to offset the weakening of the lira, and hence upwards risks in inflationary pressures are more likely to materialise,” said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koç University in Istanbul. A steeper rise in interest rates had been hotly anticipated following the return of Mehmet Şimşek, a former economist at the US embassy in Ankara and banker at Merrill Lynch and UBS, to the post of finance minister after Erdoğan’s re-election, as well as the recent appointment of the economist and banker Hafize Gaye Erkan to the post of central bank governor. Bloomberg economists estimated in May that Turkish authorities had spent $177bn (£138bn) propping up the lira since it crashed in December 2021. This week the Turkish vice-president, Cevdet Yılmaz, and Şimşek made a one-day visit to the United Arab Emirates before Erdoğan is due to visit. The two countries signed a $40bn trade agreement in March, ratified shortly after Erdoğan’s re-election, as part of deepening economic ties amid efforts by Erdoğan and other Turkish officials to attract Gulf investment amid a foreign currency shortage. In January last year, the Turkish central bank and its Emirati counterpart agreed a £3.8bn currency swap."

The musician, producer and rapper came to Turkey in 2014 after being arrested by the regime in Syria and accused of smuggling weapons, which he denies. He panicked about how to make a living and survive in a new country until seeing a video of a busker on Istiklal Avenue, one of Istanbul’s most famous streets. Despite his daf being confiscated by the Turkish police (musicians must have a permit to perform but, according to Alkilani, there is no clear way to get one), he persevered and eventually found a community and a source of opportunities. It was through busking that he met a friend of the Turkish band Debdebe and got his big break when he was invited to perform with them. The band are a trio who play a mix of electronic and Turkish music. Alkilani first joined them to rap in Arabic at a gig in Istanbul in 2019. There has been a surge in anti-Syrian sentiment from politicians in Turkey in recent years, particularly in the lead-up to the elections last month. But on the music scene of Turkey’s most populous city, which is home to more than 540,000 Syrians, there are signs of cultural acceptance and cohesion. Dunya Habash, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, has undertaken ethnographic research and says that Istanbul has become a new cultural centre for Syrians. Many of the Syrian musicians Habash spoke to during her research began performing on Istiklal Avenue when they first arrived in Turkey – a new cultural practice for them, as street music is not common in Syria. Serkan Hakki, 30, arrived in Istanbul with his clarinet in 2015 after fleeing Aleppo two years earlier and then making a perilous journey by boat to Greece. Hakki aims “to be that bridge between these two cultures [Turkish and Arabic]”.

Funding to Turkey’s border force operations has increased substantially from 2019, when £14,000 was given to Turkish police and coastguard for maritime border security training, according to documents obtained through freedom of information (FOI) requests. In addition to funding, the Home Office has also supplied Turkish border forces, including the National Police and the coastguard, with equipment and training. In June 2022, nine vehicles were handed over by the UK’s deputy high commissioner to the Turkish National Police on the border with Iran. Last year Turkey said it “turned back” 238,448 migrants at its eastern border with Iran. Video evidence seen by the Guardian shows cases of extreme violence and force used against Afghan migrants attempting to cross the border into Turkey. Mahmut Kaçan, a Turkish lawyer working on asylum and human rights abuses, said the deaths and pushbacks on the border began escalating two years ago. “The UNHCR never criticises or mentions what Turkey is doing at the border. They are complicit in the deaths of these people, as are the EU and other countries that are giving money to Turkey for border security.” A source with knowledge of the Home Office International Operations team said Turkey had become “a country of emerging importance [to the UK government] in the last two to three years and is now seen as strategically crucial to border securitisation”."

At a swearing in where he attempted to strike a unifying tone in contrast with much of his campaign, Erdoğan said: “We will embrace all 85 million people of Turkey, regardless of their political view, roots, creed or sect.” Also in attendance was the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, reportedly in Turkey to pressure Ankara to allow Sweden to join the organisation “as early as possible”. Erdoğan, whose re-election was buoyed up by a newly hard-right coalition in the Turkish parliament, has repeatedly accused Sweden of harbouring Kurdish militants hostile to the Turkish state. The Turkish president won re-election with 52.18% compared with his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu with 47.82% last week, after a campaign where the opposition challenged Erdoğan on his economic record as well as the country’s increasing shift towards one-man rule. The choice to appoint Hakan Fidan, the longtime head of Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization (MIT), as foreign minister to replace tenured diplomat Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu suggests a future potential shift in Turkey’s style of foreign relations. Erdoğan’s decision to name Şimşek finance minister was heralded in the domestic and financial press in advance of the announcement, with the move expected to reassure markets as the Turkish lira hit a new low during Erdoğan’s inauguration, trading near 21 to the dollar. Şimşek’s appointment, along with a potential new head of the Turkish central bank, provided tentative signs that Erdoğan could be willing to relinquish some of his control over the central bank, as well as move away from economic policies founded on his belief that interest rates cause, rather than curb, inflation. Şimşek previously served as Erdoğan’s deputy prime minister prior to the introduction of a presidential system, as well as minister of finance after seven years at investment firm Merrill Lynch, a short period with UBS on Wall Street and as chief economist at the US embassy in Ankara."

As Mr Erdoğan embarks on a record third decade in power with a conservative and nationalist mandate – and with increasingly authoritarian powers to enforce it – millions of other Turkish residents also have good grounds to disbelieve his sunny rhetoric. As the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has noted, Mr Erdoğan won in elections that were free but not fair; the president controls the vast majority of Turkish media, while political opponents have been harried and, in some cases, jailed. As the Turkish lira sinks to a new record low following Mr Erdoğan’s re-election, the need to alleviate the deepening economic crisis may create new opportunities for negotiation and rapprochement.

On Monday morning, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley predicted the Turkish currency would drop further this year, reaching 26 or even 28 to the dollar more quickly than previously anticipated. Addressing his supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace in Ankara on Sunday evening, Erdoğan struck a hawkish tone after his victory, taking swipes at his political opponents and committing to continue his unorthodox economic policies before reciting a nationalist poem. The Turkish leader was triumphant after a win over his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, fending off an unprecedented second-round election challenge to beat the head of the opposition with 52.16% of the vote to Kılıçdaroğlu’s 47.84%. “This result will tempt Erdoğan to say he can stay the course,” said Soner Cagaptay, a biographer of the Turkish leader and an analyst at the US thinktank the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Just three months before, his presidential sedan weaved between mounds of rubble where grieving citizens hunted for their relatives’ bodies after two powerful earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey. When pronouncing victory, Erdoğan reiterated promises of free natural gas to his supporters, boasting of Turkey’s economic independence from the International Monetary Fund and repeating his belief that cutting interest rates would reduce, rather than increase, inflation. Erdoğan reiterated a promise to continue a policy of repatriating Syrian refugees after riding a wave of hardline nationalist sentiment that saw the former ultranationalist presidential candidate Sinan Oğan joined him to declare victory in Ankara. The same nationalist sentiment also resulted in the most rightwing parliament in Turkey’s recent history, prompting observers to warn that Erdoğan was likely to increase attacks on the LGBTQ+ community and women. Declaring victory on top of a bus near his residence in Istanbul, he urged his supporters to join him in labelling every opposition party “LGBT”."

Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, was recently sentenced to more than two years in prison and banned from holding public office for insulting members of the supreme election council. During his first victory speech in Istanbul last night, Erdoğan targeted LGBTQ+ groups again. Many have argued that Turkey has never had a more ultra-conservative and misogynistic parliament than it does now. The Free Cause party is closely affiliated with Kurdish Hezbollah, a Sunni militant group that originated in the Turkish south-east and gained notoriety in the 1990s when its members tortured and killed hundreds of Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) members and supporters, as well as others who opposed its ideology, though it has since officially renounced violence. The dangers facing women and LGBTQ+ people in Turkey have already increased in recent years. Erdoğan compared abortions to murder in 2012, and although he failed to introduce a law that would have banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, women across Turkey still struggle to access safe terminations. Women’s Day marches have increasingly been met with police violence and the Istanbul Pride parade has been banned since 2015. In 2021, Erdoğan unilaterally withdrew Turkey from the Istanbul convention, an international treaty to fight gender-based discrimination and violence. EU politicians are perhaps a little too relieved that the Turkish president, who has been a willing partner in their project to keep refugees out of EU states, will remain in power. For them, Kati Piri, a Dutch MP and former Turkey EU rapporteur, had one question: “What’s your message to the 25 million people who voted for restoration of democracy and rule of law?” Constanze Letsch is a former Turkey correspondent for the Guardian and has recently finished a PhD on urban renewal in Istanbul"

Erdoğan’s success will have significant consequences for Turkey’s economy, minority groups and refugees, and the country’s position on the international stage – and it could pave the way for a significant consolidation of his power. Before the first round of the Turkish election, most analysts viewed a victory for opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu as a real possibility. His 4% margin – comfortable, but not a landslide – suggests that there will be “no real change of course in Turkey,” says Soner Cagaptay, senior fellow at the Washington Institute thinktank in the US. “If you see what’s happening in Turkey as simply about manipulating the state, you’re ignoring the really broad social support for what Erdoğan represents,” Ziya Meral said. “That comes with a subtext of Turkish-US relations,” Meral said. “If there is progress in Washington on the sale of F-16 fighter jets that Turkey wants, or if Biden hosts Erdoğan in the White House, some sort of normalisation is possible.” Meanwhile, Erdoğan will press on with attempts to find new investment for the Turkish economy among previously adversarial countries in the Middle East “and wherever he can find it”, Meral said, with the old goal of EU membership in tatters. Turkey’s Kurdish minority were seen as important to Kılıçdaroğlu’s hopes of victory. That is because, since 2015 and the collapse of the peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – which Turkey views as a terrorist group – Erdoğan has prosecuted a wide-ranging crackdown. Meanwhile, Erdoğan has frequently attacked the rights of Turkey’s LGBTQ+ community with appeals to the importance of “a strong family”. And there has been a suspected rise in femicides since Turkey withdrew from the Istanbul convention on violence against women."

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has led Turkey for 20 years, has been announced as the winner of a run-off. Thousands of Erdoğan’s supporters have gathered on the streets of Ankara this evening to celebrate his victory. A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had “reiterated the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey” and that the two had “agreed to continue working closely together to address shared challenges”. Western capitals remained silent through Turkey’s presidential campaign – privately hoping Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s erratic 20-year rule would come to a surprise close – but now he has been handed a decisive mandate to serve a third term, the west is caught between fear and hope. Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin called Erdoğan a “dear friend” and praised his “personal contribution to the strengthening of friendly Russian-Turkish relations”. “The election victory was a natural result of your selfless work as the head of the Republic of Turkey, clear evidence of the support of the Turkish people for your efforts to strengthen state sovereignty and conduct an independent foreign policy,” it said. Turkey is a member of Nato, and has been broadly supportive of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion last year, but has sought to maintain economic and diplomatic ties with Russia. President Erdoğan has called for “unity and solidarity” in a victory speech outside the presidential palace in Ankara. He pledged to focus on building stability and confidence in the Turkish economy and bringing down inflation, which according to World Bank figures stood at 72.3% in 2022."

With 99.43% of the vote counted, Turkey’s supreme election authority announced late on Sunday that Erdoğan had won 52.14% of the votes, while Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%. Even before the result was called, a triumphant Erdoğan stood on top of a bus near his residence in Istanbul to once again sing a campaign song to his adherents and pronounce victory. The victory for Turkey’s longest-serving leader affords him both another term in office as president, and an endorsement of his populist style of politics after he emerged victorious in an election that challenged his rule. The Turkish leader has spent two decades reshaping the country in his own image, concentrating power on his office, detaining opponents and instituting increasingly unorthodox economic policies. Despite this, he gained support in many of the areas of Turkey worst hit by the country’s financial troubles, as well as areas levelled in twin deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in south-east Turkey. “We are not the only ones who have won, Turkey has won … our democracy has won,” Erdoğan later told his supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace. The Turkish president went on to boast of Turkey’s economic independence despite a financial crisis linked to his policies, one sparking a rising cost of living crisis among his citizens. At the headquarters of his Republican People’s party (CHP) in the Turkish capital, Kılıçdaroğlu attempted to console his supporters, but made no suggestion he could stand down as opposition leader. Kılıçdaroğlu and his opposition coalition campaigned on the promise of returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy, pledging to reverse many of the changes that have marked Erdoğan’s two decades of rule, including concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. While the opposition holds mayorships in Turkey’s six largest cities, Kılıçdaroğlu’s campaign appeared to run aground outside his party’s traditional enclaves on the Aegean coast and in metropolitan centres."

Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. Perhaps it was merely campaign rhetoric, but it reflects a mindset in Turkey and potentially in other countries. Erdoğan’s first test will come at the Nato summit in Vilnius where he will be asked to lift Turkey’s veto on the Nato membership of Sweden. Stockholm is toughening its anti-terror laws to please Ankara and is willing to study evidence that the Kurdish community in Sweden has become a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and Turkey. Officials pretend Sweden’s Nato membership is a self-standing issue but in practice most see it as linked to the blocked US arms sales to Turkey, not to mention the future status of the battery of S-400 missiles bought by Ankara from Russia. Joe Biden, despite calling Erdoğan an autocrat, is willing to lift the block, endorse the $20bn sale of F16 jets and open a new chapter with Turkey. McCaul said: “We’ve been assured that after the election, regardless of the winner, that Sweden will be recognised as a Nato ally.” Democrats in Congress still want wider assurances about Turkey stopping its threats to Greece, so talks of a moratorium on military exercises in the Aegean is promising. In the campaign he said Turkey and Russia had a special relationship, and reflected on his personal ties with Putin, saying it put him in a good position to act as a broker over the war in Ukraine. In April Erdoğan launched the first Turkish nuclear power plant built with Russian financial support and technology. More implausibly Putin has talked of Turkey becoming a European hub for Russian gas. All of this has made it harder for the US officials that have travelled to Ankara to urge Erdoğan to clamp down on Turkish businesses acting as a conduit to bypass western sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine."

A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdoğan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first-round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters. At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdoğan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round. Kılıçdaroğlu has offered voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey’s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdoğan’s tenure, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey’s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. Kılıçdaroğlu’s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the runoff, as well as signing an agreement with Özdağ including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey whom he previously relied on for support in the first round. The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. “This is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second-round vote in a presidential election. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey’s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdoğan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems. Voters in the town of Kahramanmaraş, close to the epicentres of twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdoğan was a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival. Balta said: “I think this has played out in an intense way in the Turkish election because the extent of polarisation in this country is so high."

Interspersed with soft rock soundtracking footage of the campaign trail are speeches where he promises to deport the roughly four million refugees currently in Turkey. Campaigners from Kılıçdaroğlu’s Republican People’s party (CHP) hand out Turkish flags and leaflets bearing his campaign promises, including a flyer bearing the words “refugees will return home”, showing a figure scaling a wire fence at sunset. A coalition between Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) and three nationalist parties surpassed expectations and won a majority in the parliament, part of an old alliance between Erdoğan and hard-right political elements that brought nationalist elements into the ruling coalition, even as Turkey welcomed millions of refugees from Syria. The campaign before Sunday’s runoff vote saw both Erdoğan and Kılıçdaroğlu courting hardcore nationalist voters in an election where growing numbers looking to show their discontent with two decades of Erdoğan’s rule have aligned themselves with ultranationalist, anti-refugee elements in Turkish politics. Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of a historically socially democratic party, has doubled down on pledges to deport all refugees within a year of coming to power and hardened his rhetoric, including releasing campaign material falsely inflating the number of Syrian and Afghan refugees in Turkey by several million. Turkey’s opposition, primarily composed of the CHP along with their nationalist coalition partners the Iyi party, have sought to oppose Erdoğan by challenging his decision to grant temporary protection status to about 3.6 million Syrians, as well as making a deal with the EU that granted Turkey €6bn (£5.2bn) in support in return for preventing migration into the bloc. Under Erdoğan, Turkish authorities have cracked down on migration flows from Afghanistan and Syria while recently seeking to mend relations with Damascus, prompting Erdoğan to say he believes Syrians are safe to return."

Turkey’s presidential elections offers voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power, where he oversaw sweeping reforms and a construction boom as well as a growing financial crisis and a crackdown on his opponents. But what initially appeared to be a referendum on his rule has come to represent a missed opportunity for Turkey’s opposition in the first round, leaving Erdoğan’s rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu trailing in the vote and searching for a path to victory in the runoff. Kılıçdaroğlu pulled ahead with a slim margin in Turkey’s largest cities, where inflation and a biting economic crisis are most keenly felt."

Yeni is one of 3.4 million Turkish voters in Europe registered to cast their ballots abroad. Almost 66% of Turkish voters in Germany backed the conservative incumbent. “You live abroad, you’re not much affected by what’s going on at home, yet you feel closer to it than to your adopted country – the temptation is to vote for someone who flatters your religious and national identity,” said Claire Koç, a Franco-Turkish writer. I see this for myself on A Haber [a private, pro-government Turkish TV news channel]. Hüseyin, 68, a Turkish Kurd clutching amber prayer beads, who received political asylum in Germany five years ago, said he would meet friends at a roundabout cafe in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district to watch the results on Sunday evening. “Voters in Germany as elsewhere, consider this election as a significant juncture for Turkey, which has meant mobilisation has increased over the past week or so, with people feeling they have to make a very clear statement,” said Burç. Holding his scottish terrier Charlie, 36-year-old Yasin Acarbaş, a Berlin resident who left Turkey a decade ago after the Gezi Park protests, said: “I don’t feel I should have the right to vote when I’m not living in a country. Elif, 36, a student, standing in front of a large Turkish flag stretched across the consulate railings taking selfies with three friends, said she had turned up to vote “so that Turkey wins”. In places like the Baltic states, where polling stations have been opened for Turkish voters for the first time this year, Kılıçdaroğlu is the favourite."

The Victory party leader, Ümit Özdağ, declared at a joint press conference with Kılıçdaroğlu that the two had signed a memorandum of understanding, including guarantees to deport all refugees in Turkey within a year of coming to power. They also agreed not to reinstate democratically elected Kurdish mayors in Turkey’s south-east previously replaced with appointees as part of a state crackdown on the leftwing and mostly Kurdish People’s Democratic party (HDP) – a swipe at the Kurdish support that buoyed Kılıçdaroğlu in the first round. Throughout his campaign, including at his largest rally in Istanbul, Kılıçdaroğlu declared he would expel all refugees in Turkey “within two years” of coming to power. Both leaders cited vastly inflated figures for the numbers of refugees and asylum seekers currently in Turkey, estimated to be around 4 million, including at least 3.6 million Syrians under a temporary protection order imposed by Erdoğan. Just 2.2% of Turkish voters say refugees are the country’s biggest problem when polled, compared with more than 56% concerned about a profound economic crisis that saw the lira lose half its value in one year alone."

By 3am on the morning of 15 May, when Recep Tayyip Erdoğan gave a triumphant speech to the crowd outside his party’s headquarters in Ankara, extolling his unexpected lead over the opposition and a surprise majority for his coalition in parliament, the young voters were still awake but their hopes for change had been crushed. Turkey’s opposition, led by the former accountant Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, forced Erdoğan into a second-round runoff, a rare setback for the incumbent leader of two decades. Turkey’s opposition, meanwhile, is reckoning with a lack of enthusiasm among its supporters. When polled before the first round, the majority of voters said their greatest concern was Turkey’s ongoing economic crisis. Like Ayten, Feyyaz had rushed home to watch the returns, following attentively when the Istanbul and Ankara mayors, Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş, declared that the opposition was ahead and that counts shared by the state news agency Anadolu should not be trusted. “[Turkey’s] general elections were well-managed and offered voters a choice between genuine political alternatives, but the current president and the ruling parties enjoyed an unjustified advantage,” they said. In a desperate effort to close the gap on his opponent and garner votes from Turkey’s nationalist right, Kılıçdaroğlu hardened his rhetoric and doubled down on promises to deport millions of refugees. He also called for more electoral observers, sidestepping accusations from Turkish journalists that the CHP had left 20,000 ballot boxes without observers in the first round despite their promises of tight election security."

The Turkish lira, which has devalued steadily in recent years including halving in value in one year alone, dropped close to a historic low as markets opened the morning after Sunday’s vote. “Instead, there is now a very real risk that an Erdoğan victory could lead to macroeconomic instability in Turkey, including the threat of a severe currency crisis and strains in the banking and sovereign debt positions further down the line.” Turkey is the world’s 19th largest economy, according to the World Bank. It has noted that the Turkish economic crisis of the past five years has been accompanied by efforts to support economic growth “with credit booms and demand stimulus”. Economists from Bloomberg estimate the Turkish central bank has spent more than $177bn supporting the lira since December 2021. The Turkish Inflation Research Group (ENAG), which measures inflation on a basket of goods and services, recorded a 105.19% price increase last month on the previous year, adding that prices were up by almost a third compared with the beginning of 2023. The price of onions, a staple in Turkish cuisine, quickly became a talking point in the election after Kılıçdaroğlu released a video last month stating: “Now, one kilogram of onions is 30 liras, if [Erdoğan] stays it will be 100 liras.” We have already fixed problems in Turkey,” he said. The US credit rating agency Fitch Ratings pointed to Turkey’s dwindling foreign reserves caused by attempts to stabilise the lira, forecasting difficulties for the next government. The prospect that members of Turkey’s six-party opposition coalition could secure victory in order to restore international confidence in the Turkish economy and return to more orthodox economic policies appeared increasingly unlikely. Speaking before the first round of voting, the economist Bilge Yılmaz, of the nationalist IYI party, said Turkey’s economic crisis potentially outstripped anything the country had endured in decades. “Turkey right now is deprived of foreign capital because it’s not predictable, it’s not trustworthy … there are effectively zero dollars left, for all practical purposes zero,” he said."

That outcome will stymie opposition attempts to restore parliamentary democracy to Turkey, irrespective of the result of the presidential runoff in a fortnight’s time. For Europe and the US, which had hoped an opposition victory would see Turkey turn more towards the west, five more years of Mr Erdoğan would be a highly unwelcome development – particularly ahead of a decisive period in Ukraine. Turkey’s Kurdish minority population, dissidents, journalists, women’s rights campaigners and LGBTQ+ people have all been subject to political repression in recent years, as the president has shored up his popularity through culture wars and a focus on terrorism and security. If Mr Erdoğan survives this, the most concerted and unified democratic challenge to his power to date, the temptation to move Turkey further down the road towards full-blown autocracy will be considerable. Unless Mr Kılıçdaroğlu can convince enough of them otherwise, the medium-term prospects for Turkish democracy look bleak."

Kılıçdaroğlu outperformed Erdoğan in around 30 constituencies in the presidential election, primarily those in areas where the opposition candidate’s CHP party already enjoys significant popularity, such as the more liberal Aegean coast, the southern regions of the country, and Turkish Thrace in the far west. Notably, Kılıçdaroğlu garnered a substantial share of the vote in southeast Turkey, which comprises provinces with a predominantly Kurdish population and where the left-wing Yesil Sol party secured the majority of parliamentary seats. Though the Kurdish vote was touted as the determining factor in this election – and the results do suggest it remains a crucial part of Kılıçdaroğlu’s electoral coalition – the opposition alliance will still need to gain more voters on the Turkish right to get Kılıçdaroğlu over 50% in a second round. Excluding the country’s three largest cities of Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara, however, Erdoğan appears to have got a consistently larger share than Kılıçdaroğlu throughout Anatolia in a total of 51 provinces, including the cities of Bursa and Konya (where he would have expected to win).

Kılıçdaroğlu, a member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, said he intends to step back from Erdoğan’s heavy-handed control of public institutions and the media, promising a more inclusive Turkey and an end to the combative style of politics that Erdoğan is known for. The CHP leader has also promised to deport millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees who sought shelter in Turkey from conflicts at home. Voters across Turkey said that a worsening cost of living crisis and the government’s response to twin deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people were what drove them to the polls.

The elections are crucial to the future of Turkey’s battered economy – but also as a marker of the state of democracy in an era of strongman leaders in fragile democracies around the world. “And Turkey is a major player on the world stage – it’s a member of Nato, and it’s a fundamental, if flawed, partner for the west in dealing with Russia. “It feels like Turkey has had a lot of last chances,” Ruth said. While Erdoğan grip on the levers of power has brought Turkey close to autocracy, he has made serious economic missteps recently (£). Ordinary Turkish people are far poorer and more uncertain of their futures as a result. “It highlighted the flaws and corruption in the construction industry which he empowered as the backbone of his rule, so that you felt the presence of the state through airports or new roads far from Istanbul or Ankara,” Ruth said.

Since becoming prime minister in 2003, Erdoğan – Turkey’s most influential ruler since the founding of the republic by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 100 years ago – has reshaped the country in his image. Over the past decade, the reis, or boss, has cracked down on peaceful protests and freedom of speech, overturned the results of the general election in 2015, renewed Turkey’s war against the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), purged the country of his enemies in the wake of the 2016 coup attempt, persuaded Turkey to switch to a presidential system, and embarked on ambitious and unpredictable foreign policy adventures. The conservative 69-year-old and his AKP still command deep loyalty from many religious Turks, who were marginalised by a secular ruling elite for decades: by some estimates, he still enjoys 45% support. The 2019 mayoral race in Istanbul showed that Turkey’s ailing democratic institutions still had a pulse, and despite controlling much of the media and other supposedly independent institutions, that the AKP was not as all-powerful as it seemed. When polling stations closed at 5pm (3pm BST) on Sunday, preliminary data from Turkey’s main election body suggested Erdoğan had an early lead of 56.7% compared with Kılıçdaroğlu, on 37.4%, with 17% of votes counted. As the 2019 mayoral election in Istanbul proved, one of the most crucial moments in Turkish elections now begins after the polls close. After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey’s electoral board upheld a complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled the opposition victory. An alliance of six ideologically diverse opposition parties has presented a united front in this year’s election, trying to attract votes from Turkey’s Kurdish minority and working-class conservatives disillusioned by economic pain and the lack of support after February’s earthquakes."

A weighted poll of all Turkish election polls, 600 Vekil, predicted a 63% chance of a Kılıçdaroğlu victory. Turkey’s six-party opposition coalition is vying to win both a parliamentary majority and the presidency in order to enact sweeping reforms, overhauling two decades of Erdoğan policies and returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy. Democracy is a very beautiful, wonderful thing,” said Kılıçdaroğlu, who has campaigned as an answer to Turkey’s increasingly polarised political environment and what his supporters say is Erdoğan’s divisive rhetoric. “Turkey will get the democracy it deserves soon,” said 33-year-old Sevin, who was certain that the opposition were on the verge of victory. In the Istanbul district of Kasımpaşa, where Erdoğan grew up, three voters in their mid-20s said they were all voting for the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP). “Our only aim is to take him down,” said İlhan Pekgoz outside a polling station in Istanbul. Kılıçdaroğlu, a member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, says he intends to build a more inclusive society and step back from Erdoğan’s heavy-handed control of public institutions and the media. Kılıçdaroğlu has also promised to deport millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees who sought shelter in Turkey from conflicts at home. Kılıçdaroğlu later accused Russia of election interference and creating deepfake videos, declaring: “If you want the continuation of our friendship after 15 May, get your hands off the Turkish state. Supporters of Erdoğan and the AKP rebuffed concerns about Turkey’s ongoing economic crisis and repeated their claim there was a need for the country to remain unified, alluding to the country’s deep political polarisation as well as concerns that Erdoğan’s reign might be nearing its end."

In the weeks before the vote, he declared that Turkish citizens would enjoy free natural gas, raised the salaries of public sector workers by 45% after an initial rise earlier this year, and even declared that Turkey had struck oil. A new gargantuan grey warship docked in Istanbul over a recent holiday weekend, inviting citizens to walk on deck and enjoy the splendour of Turkey’s new high-tech future. After initially promising a quieter election campaign following a deadly earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey just three months ago, Erdoğan changed tactics after many polls suggested that opposition challenger Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu is in the lead. At a mass rally in Istanbul last weekend, the president broadcast an alleged deepfake video showing a group of banned Kurdish militants expressing their support for his competitor, both of which he regularly portrays as enemies of the state. Erdoğan, who leads the AKP party, has promised a “century of Turkey”, a grand vision that contains much of the supercharged nationalism and populist rhetoric that has allowed him to keep his grip on the country. Turkey’s opposition, led by Kılıçdaroğlu, campaigned on the promise that “spring will come again”, pledging to overhaul Erdoğan’s policies that have reshaped the country throughout his two decades in power: chief among them a return to parliamentary democracy. “No one really knows what a post-Erdoğan Turkey would look like in reality,” said James Ryan of the US thinktank the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Construction and infrastructure formed the backbone of Erdoğan’s two decades in power, projecting the presence of the state through smooth roads, new airports and vast new buildings in even the smallest Turkish towns – amid accusations of widespread corruption in the construction industry. Almost a month after she and her family of four were displaced from their home in the southernmost province of Hatay, Elise Aslan grew frustrated with officials from Turkey’s disaster relief agency, AFAD, when they tried to outline her payment options for government housing."

At another rally earlier this month, Erdoğan accused every party in Turkey’s opposition coalition of being LGBT. When Turkish voters go to the polls in parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 May, LGBTQ+ rights as well as women’s rights will be on the ballot. Erdoğan has withdrawn Turkey from the Council of Europe’s Istanbul convention on violence against women and pushed a conservative vision of family values while attacking groups that defend women and queer rights. For many Turkish women and the LGBTQ+ community, the forthcoming vote represents a stark choice. “LGBTQ rights are considered human rights in a changing world, but this concept doesn’t exist in Turkey.” Despite plenty of highly visible female candidates as well as a handful of openly trans candidates standing for the Workers’ party of Turkey, representation has some way to go. Akşener has spoken openly of Turkey’s need to return to the Istanbul convention, but has been more cautious on gay rights, stating that while she would be unhappy with a gay child she was also against violence towards LGBTQ+ people. EŞİK has estimated that 117 female deputies will be elected to Turkey’s 600-seat parliament, putting the proportion of women in the assembly at just under a fifth. “We see in these elections that political representation is unequal,” says Gülsüm Kav, a co-founder of the group We Will Stop Femicide (WWSF), which fights violence against women and LGBTQ+ people in Turkey. Turkey was only just beginning to see the effects of its withdrawal from the Istanbul convention in 2021, says Kav, amid a suspected rise in femicides that her organisation is continuing to monitor. There are few guarantees that Turkey’s opposition would change things overnight, although the six-party opposition coalition is promising several policies including strengthening equal pay for women and “removing the language and visuals of violence from living spaces”. There is, however, no mention of rejoining the Istanbul convention or of LGBTQ+ rights."

Erdoğan, who previously lashed out at the US ambassador Jeff Flake for publicly meeting with Kılıçdaroğlu, has declared that “Turkey will give a message to the west with this election.” His interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, went even further, describing the vote on 14 May as “a political coup attempt by the west”. Under Erdoğan’s leadership, Turkey transformed into a presidential system supported by a vast patronage network loyal to his Justice and Development party (AKP), rebuffing an attempted military coup in 2016 and often branding his opponents enemies of the state. Erdoğan has also increased Turkey’s footprint overseas and reshaped its economy in his image, overseeing vast infrastructure projects and development but also an economic crisis in which the Turkish lira has halved in value in the past year alone. “As we get closer to the vote, I feel excited but also responsible for the fate of 85 million people across Turkey,” said Canan Kaftancıoğlu, a leading member of the CHP, currently weathering a ban from politics after a court charged her with insulting Erdoğan. “I believe this election will set an example, not just for Turkey but for the whole world. In the parliamentary elections, polls also suggest Erdoğan’s coalition could lose its governing majority, but the opposition must win a majority in parliament and the presidency to ensure they achieve their primary aim of returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy. The campaign trail has been pockmarked with violence towards opposition figures with a bullet being thrown inside the CHP’s local offices in one town, a day after a group threw stones at supporters and the campaign bus of the leading opposition figure and Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu."

When polled, at least 80% of Turks say they want Syrians to return. This sentiment has found an increasing home across the political spectrum in Turkey, amid a rise in openly anti-immigrant xenophobic parties and where a broad coalition trying to unseat the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has attacked him from the right on immigration. The result has been a tug-of-war between Erdoğan’s governing coalition and the nominally social democratic opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) over the fate of Turkey’s Syrian community. When Turkey heads to the polls on Sunday the Syrian community is poised to endure loss no matter who wins. Anti-refugee sentiment runs high within the CHP despite the party touting its social democratic credentials, and one local branch invited the media to watch as Syrians from their district boarded buses bound for Turkey’s southern border. Turkey’s defence minister and intelligence chief have repeatedly met their Syrian counterparts, the highest-level meetings in more than a decade. The Syrian foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, told reporters Ankara would have to pull back its troops from northern Syria for a full rapprochement between the two leaders to be possible. Still the possibility of a full reconciliation with the Syrian leadership has been enough for Erdoğan to claim that Syrians based in Turkey are safe to return. Twin earthquakes in February that killed almost 60,000 across southern Turkey and northern Syria and destroyed homes and infrastructure in a strip of land under Turkish control have done little to dissuade Erdoğan, who has boasted of Turkish-built tower blocks in Idlib being ready for returnees. The bleak towers were visible on an Idlib hillside but are reportedly largely empty or populated with Syrians who never left for Turkey, according to local people."

Not since the huge anti-government Gezi park protests in 2013 have the people of Turkey put their eternal conflicts to the side like this in order to take on Erdoğan’s palace, which effectively runs everything from the economy to the judiciary. The party-state he has built, under the banner of his Justice and Development party (AKP), has not only undermined all the democratic mechanisms in Turkey but also created a model citizen who believes in submission to the regime – the millions who see themselves in Erdoğan’s image. Doctors, for their part, have been leaving Turkey in thousands, as have academics, engineers and well-educated people, who feel unsafe in a country increasingly defined by a combination of conservative religiosity and thuggish politics. Just this Sunday, an opposition bus in the AKP-run Erzurum, east Turkey, was pelted with stones during a rally. Kılıçdaroğlu, the main opposition leader and dubbed the Gandhi of Turkish politics, and his allies keep making the heart-shape with their hands in every mass rally. After 20 years as Turkey’s most dominant politician, he can count on a wide range of support thanks to the web of political money that spans the country to feed his supporters, the fear of all things foreign that he inculcates in many Turkish people, and his mastery in exploiting religious sensitivities. But he knows well that electoral loss could lead to him and his close circle ending up in court, both domestically and even internationally given Turkey’s alleged war crimes in Syria.

Abroad, he has asserted Turkey’s influence in the region and loosened its ties with the west. In the parliamentary elections, held concurrently, the number of seats a party wins in Turkey’s 600-member parliament is directly proportional to the number of votes it receives, providing it gets – alone or as part of an alliance – at least 7% of the national vote. Polling stations will open to Turkey’s 61 million voters at 8am local time on Sunday 14 May and close at 5pm, with results expected in the evening. The country’s most powerful leader since Atatürk, who founded modern Turkey a century ago, Erdoğan, 69, has steered Turkey away from secularism and in 2018 abolished its parliamentary system, centralising power in the presidency. From his 1,000-room palace outside Ankara, he in effect dictates government policy and has, critics say, eroded democracy, stifling dissent and bringing media and judges under his sway. Economists also blame Erdoğan for the country’s economic crisis, saying his insistence on low interest rates has sent inflation soaring – to 85% last year – and caused the Turkish lira to lose 80% of its value against the dollar in five years. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a 74-year-old retired civil servant, has been Turkey’s main opposition leader for more than a decade, leading his CHP party to major victories in a string of big-city municipalities including Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir. The candidate of the Nation Alliance or Table of Six has been criticised as lacking charisma and for blocking politicians from his own party – such as the high-profile mayors of Istanbul and Ankara – who may have stood a better chance of victory.

But the distinctions being drawn between the foreign policy of the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, are less a substantial reinterpretation of the Turkish national interest, more about the style, tone and predictability in securing that interest. An early indication would be if Kılıçdaroğlu – the candidate of a six-party opposition – lifted Turkey’s veto on Swedish Nato membership, possibly as early as the Nato summit in Vilnius in June. There are already signs that, with Finland now permitted entry by the Turks, Erdoğan himself knows the benefit of continuing to veto Sweden over what it claims – and Sweden denies – is the harbouring of Kurdish terrorists will soon have served its electoral purpose. But Nato would also welcome a restoration of the prestige of the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs – as promised by the opposition – so western diplomats are less prone to being blindsided by Erdoğan’s kind of mercurial negotiating tactics over Nato, or indeed over Greece, Libya and Cyprus. “We want a Turkey that is perceived as a like-minded member of the western states community.” Çeviköz, for instance, says Erdoğan’s purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defence system in 2017 was “a big mistake and we paid dearly for it”, a reference to the US subsequently pushing Turkey out of the joint F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet programme, as well as from the purchase of F-16s. But anti-Americanism has been fed for a long time by the Turkish president. When the US ambassador to Turkey, Jeff Flake, met the opposition in March, a quite normal diplomatic exchange, Erdoğan vowed to “teach the Americans a lesson” and accused the west of tampering with the Turkish elections."

His security detail – in full suit and aviators despite the heat of Turkey’s Mediterranean coast – clasped a handful of campaign leaflets. When Turks go to the polls in simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections on Sunday, the choice will be stark: a complete overhaul of a system that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have spent 20 years constructing, or re-electing a president seeking to further concentrate power around his office. Showing voters what Turkey could look like without Erdoğan remains a challenge. The president has spent two decades shaping the country to his vision of a conservative society and an assertive regional player, replacing Turkey’s parliamentary democracy with a presidential system that vastly expanded his powers, and using the courts to crack down on dissent in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt in 2016. From the perspective of Turkey’s opposition, a biting economic crisis and a lacklustre response to twin earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people should suffice to convince the public to vote Erdoğan out. Some polls suggest that Erdoğan’s governing coalition could lose its majority in parliament, but that is only half the battle, as the six-party opposition coalition – which includes the İyi party – needs to win both parliament and the presidency to enact its pledge to convert Turkey back to a parliamentary democracy. Still, the opposition believes that Turkey’s crippling financial crisis and concerns about how the country is being run will help its ideas triumph over personality-driven politics. Voters in Antalya, a tourist and agricultural hub of 2.6 million people whose surrounding farmlands feed a large portion of the Turkish population, are hurting from the economic crisis, and complain of rising housing costs linked to an influx of Russian and Ukrainian people after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Challenging an incumbent, one with a 20-year record of adapting to an increasingly right-leaning political climate and reshaping Turkey in his image, is no small task, but Poyraz demurs."

A member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, Kılıçdaroğlu’s candidacy is considered boundary-breaking. His ascent to presidential candidate has taken decades, galvanised through a 280-mile (450km) march from Ankara to Istanbul in 2017 to protest against arrests following a 2016 coup attempt. Now heading a six-party opposition coalition, he has also worked to garner support from Turkey’s marginalised Kurdish community, which resulted in him being given a hero’s welcome in Kurdish-majority towns. Erdoğan held his own Istanbul rally over the weekend, laying on free transportation for those wishing to join and claiming that 1.7 million people attended. On the same day, a group of assailants threw stones at supporters and a campaign bus belonging to the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, on the campaign trail in north-east Turkey. Other than promises of a socially democratic new dawn, the policies that Kılıçdaroğlu has been most vocal about include pledging to deport millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees living in Turkey, a proposition that drew cheers from the crowd in Istanbul. Asked how he intended to square this promise with a desire for Turkey to join the European Union, Kılıçdaroğlu claimed he could draw on the EU or even the United Nations for support."

The current death toll of the two earthquakes – nearing 55,000 – is more than 100 times the human cost of the failed military coup of 2016, and has now surpassed the number of people who have died in four decades of guerrilla war between the Turkish state and the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). Slow violence is not slow in Turkey. From 2022 to 2023, the government shrank AFAD’s budget by one-third, from 12.1bn to 8bn Turkish lira, while expanding the directorate’s funding by 56%, to almost 36bn lira – more than the foreign and culture ministries combined. Though Turkish citizens pay a tax officially meant to solidify buildings to withstand earthquakes, Erdoğan and his ministers have revealed that the money has largely been spent on unrelated infrastructure projects and paying back an IMF loan. In response to the parliamentarians’ questions, AFAD claimed that it had passed the money on to the state’s Turkish housing development administration. On the third day of the crisis, the authorities blocked access to Twitter in Turkey. From the first day of the crisis, the question “AFAD or Ahbap?” became a popular query on Turkish wiki sites. In spite of the government’s attitude, the Turkish population has shown a heroic readiness to help the afflicted. In the mandatory religion classes first imposed on Turkish schools by the military junta in the early 80s, every Muslim child learns that fate (kader) is an article of faith in Islam. Turkey’s location and topography render it rich in renewable resources like wind and water power, agriculture and coal, but also make the country vulnerable to a wide range of natural disasters. In 1999, a massive earthquake shook the eastern part of metropolitan Istanbul, killing 17,000 people."

In other words, the only choice for those wanting to listen to a news bulletin on a TV in Turkey is the voice of the state. Six months ago, we partnered with Reporters Without Borders (RSF), to organise digital media workshops and seminars in the Kurdish language for the first time in Turkey’s history."

Syrian local and security sources said the raid took place in the northern Syrian town of Jindires, which is controlled by Turkey-backed rebel groups and was one of the worst-affected in the 6 February earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria. “The Isis figure Abu Hussein al-Qurashi … was stationed in a military post belonging to the Turkish-backed Ahrar al-Sharqiya mercenary group and was killed in Jindires, Afrin,” said a spokesperson for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed primarily Kurdish fighting coalition in northern Syria, pointing to Turkish influence and control in Jinderes."

Whatever the truth, the episode has added to a growing sense that an authoritarian figure who has come to dominate almost every aspect of Turkish life, personally dictating domestic, security and foreign policy, is due a reckoning – and that it’s time for a change. Analysts suggest that Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party and its ultra-nationalist allies may also lose control of parliament, following previous, significant local election defeats in Istanbul and Ankara. Kurds represent about one fifth of Turkey’s 85 million population. Yet these elections are also about legacy and history, which seem to be catching up with the most powerful Turkish leader since Kemal Atatürk. About 20,000 mosques have been built in Turkey since he took power – part of his drive to “Islamicise” society and overturn Atatürk’s secular legacy. On the international stage, Erdoğan has often angered Turkey’s friends and allies by his interventions in Syria and Iraq, his courting of a fellow authoritarian leader, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, and, most recently, his de facto veto of Sweden’s bid to join Nato. But Turkey’s people do."

Turkey is holding parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 May, when Erdoğan faces a concerted challenge from a six-party opposition striving to unseat him after 20 years in power. Many polls give his main challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a slight lead, amid discontent with an ongoing economic crisis and the government’s response to deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, and 8,000 in Syria.

Iflah Oluklu, a skinny 23-year-old with bleached hair, black jeans and a fitted black T-shirt, chastised his friend for disrespecting some supporters of the Turkish president while they were playing an online video game. “Erdoğan is like a father figure for us in Turkey. The vote presents a stark choice for the Turkish public, between Erdoğan and the possibility that re-electing him will entrench one-man rule, or his opponents who have promised to overhaul the presidential system and return Turkey to parliamentary democracy. Turkey’s opposition, a six-party coalition headed by Kılıçdaroğlu and united by the sole aim of removing Erdoğan from power, believes that the problems facing the country should make this choice easy. All of this has deteriorated significantly under this presidential system,” said İbrahim Çanakcı, a Deva cofounder and former Turkish treasury official. But, most of all, he’s a person who can deliver peace to Turkey, and he’s not using polarising language like Erdoğan.” Uğur Poyraz, general secretary of the IYI party, said their hesitancy about Kılıçdaroğlu’s candidacy was because of the high stakes of this election, where Turkish democracy was on the line. As for how they plan to topple a president who had built up a cult of personality over two decades, Poyraz said he believed that reality would work in their favour, and that the Turkish public no longer trusted Erdoğan or his party. “Our problem is not with any one individual, it’s about a system that is tainting every aspect of Turkish society."

The Turkish parliament was the last among the 30 members of the alliance to ratify Finland’s membership, after Hungary’s legislature approved a similar bill this week. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said this month that Finland had secured Turkey’s blessing after moves to support its promised crackdown on groups seen by Ankara as terrorists, and to free up defence exports. But the process has been held up by Turkey and Hungary. Sweden’s faces objections from Ankara over claims it is harbouring what it considers members of terrorist groups. Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin said soon after the Turkish vote: “Finland stands with Sweden now and in the future and supports its application.” The Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs commission had unanimously approved the Finland bill last week. The Turkish legislative process was happening as it prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 May. Having completed the ratification process, Turkey and Hungary need to send their approving documents to the US government in Washington, which is the depository of Nato under the alliance’s founding treaty. Turkey is still holding off approving Sweden’s bid. Ankara says it has not gone far enough in cracking down on people Turkey considers terrorists. Turkey has repeatedly said that Sweden needed to take additional steps against supporters of Kurdish militants and members of the network Ankara holds responsible for a 2016 coup attempt. Turkey treats both groups as terrorist organisations. Talks between Sweden and Turkey have made little progress, especially after several disputes, mainly over street protests by pro-Kurdish groups in Stockholm. Stoltenberg has said he had urged Turkey and Hungary to ratify both applications."

After a choreographed meeting with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, in Ankara, Erdoğan said he would recommend to the Turkish parliament that it vote to back Finland’s application to join. He said he hoped the vote would happen before the Turkish elections in May. At a joint press conference, Erdoğan said Turkey’s concerns about Kurdish terrorist activity in Finland had been addressed. “Turkey is one of the strong defenders of Nato’s open-door policy,” he said. Finland had taken “concrete and authentic steps” to meet Turkey’s security concerns, and “with Finland’s membership Nato will become stronger”. On Thursday, Niinistö visited Turkey’s Kahramanmaraş province, which was at the centre of the 6 February earthquake that killed more than 48,000 people, and he said he was shocked by what he had seen. The decision complicates Nato defence planning, but the complexity depends on how long Turkey keeps Sweden in the Nato waiting room. Last June, Finland and Sweden signed a 10-point memorandum with Turkey to address Ankara’s security concerns, but its contents were open to interpretation as to what it required the Nordic countries to do to clamp down on Kurdish activists. In December, Finland loosened its strict embargo on arms exports to Turkey imposed in 2019 after Turkey’s attack on northern Syria. US officials believe Turkey has been trying to use its Nato veto power as a bargaining chip to extract extraneous concessions, including that the US Senate lift its objections to the sale of F-16 jets."

According to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (Afad), the death toll from the quakes has risen to more than 45,000, with at least 1.5 million people left homeless. The block of flats where Ali and his family had been living was badly damaged and has since been marked for demolition by the Turkish government. Monthly rent is cheap, at no more than about 1,500 Turkish lira (£66). Hotel prices for the tourists who arrive daily on direct flights from Istanbul are of course much higher. “Back then, many refugees fleeing home and crossing into Turkey came to Mardin – at least for a while.” According to the Turkish ministry of the interior, 85,575 Syrian refugees are registered under temporary protection in Greater Mardin. The city is located just 20 miles from the Syrian border and 120 miles from the Iraqi border, and Arabic, Turkish and Kurdish are all spoken.

In Turkey and Syria, girls are much more likely to be pulled out of school. Turkey already has one of the highest rates of child marriage in Europe. Yet instead of helping women and minorities by implementing the Istanbul convention – the treaty designed to combat violence against women – the government under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has done the opposite, withdrawing from the convention and targeting both feminists and LGBTQ+ activists. Turkey’s AKP under Erdoğan is not only antidemocratic and authoritarian, it is also blatantly macho and misogynist. Sadly, anti-refugee rhetoric has also proliferated in Turkey after this crisis. In Mersin, Syrians staying at a dormitory were kicked out, saying they had to make way for Turkish citizens. Meanwhile, on the other side of Turkey’s border in Iran, girls are being poisoned.

Birsen Berrak Tüzünataç, a film and soap opera star, won the marathon case at the ECHR, which ruled that Turkey had violated the European convention on human rights by dismissing her legal complaints. In 2010, Tüzünataç had filed a domestic suit against the parent company of a Turkish television channel that had filmed her kissing another Turkish actor on a terrace at her home. She said she had been filmed without her knowledge, in breach of her right to privacy, but in 2013 the Istanbul regional court dismissed her claim on the grounds that she had been filmed from the street and there had been no intrusion into her home. Its ruling was upheld by Turkey’s court of cassation and its constitutional court. However Turkish media had widely reported that he was Şahan Gökbakar, one of the most famous screen faces in the country and star of blockbuster comedy films. It said that as the reporting failed to adhere to the “standards of responsible journalism”, the domestic courts in Turkey “should have shown greater rigour when weighing the various interests involved”. It ruled Turkey had violated article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which enshrines respect for a person’s private life. Turkish TV personalities such as Tüzünataç, 38, while little known in the west, face immense scrutiny at home, where Turkish newspapers and websites are filled with pictures of celebrities. The ECHR, part of the pan-European rights body the Council of Europe, has regularly ruled against Turkey in recent months over cases of detained opposition figures such as the civil society activist Osman Kavala and the Kurdish leader Selahattin Demirtaş."

Even so, the site remained the last refuge for many Turks in a distorted media landscape that left many desperately seeking out alternative sources of information. “Ekşi Sözlük is immensely important, not only for free speech in Turkey but also the free flow of news, as mainstream media outlets are controlled by the government,” said the journalist Emre Kızılkaya, the head of the Turkish branch of the Vienna-based International Press Institute. “These forms of alternative media, including digital outlets, are incredibly important for Turkish democracy and Ekşi Sözlük was one of the primary channels for news and commentary in Turkey.” Turkish authorities briefly blocked Twitter after the quakes and detained at least five journalists."

Turkey is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC, but the Turkey Tribunal, an investigative body set up in 2020 by lawyers and human rights groups to collate evidence and witness testimonies, said that at least some of the alleged crimes were carried out on the territory of 45 ICC member states, as Turkey has pursued its perceived enemies well beyond its borders. The ICC presentation says there were 17 cases of enforced disappearance in which victims were abducted from Kenya, Cambodia, Gabon, Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Mongolia and Switzerland and taken back to Turkey. The targets were linked to the opposition movement, led by US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, designated as a terrorist organisation after Gülen was accused of being behind a failed coup attempt in 2016, which was followed by hundreds of thousands of arrests inside Turkey. Karaca, aged 49 at the time, is a Turkish-born teacher, who had been a school headteacher in Cambodia before moving to Mexico in 2011 where he was a college principal until late 2018. He had feared that he was being watched by Turkish intelligence because he had been working in a school linked to the Gülen movement. After being held incommunicado for four days, Karaca was handed over to Turkish authorities who flew him back to Turkey on a small government jet. He was convicted of leading an armed terrorist group in the 2016 coup attempt, despite the fact he had left Turkey for Cambodia in 2002. The tribunal says Karaca is just one of many Turks living abroad who have been designated as “terrorists” because of links to Gulenist schools or other institutions. The Turkish foreign minister has so far not responded to a request for comment. The Turkey Tribunal points out there is a precedent for investigating the crimes of a non-signatory state. In the case of Turkey, it argues, “the crimes were committed on the territory of 45 party states, for which the ICC has territorial jurisdiction."

Though such displays of foreign sympathy and generosity have been widely welcomed in Turkey, there is concern that the quakes may cause tourists to reconsider their Turkish holiday plans this year. In my own case the earthquakes occurred in the week that I was to lead a winter tour of Istanbul and Cappadocia. As a travel writer who has been leading small-group cultural tours to Turkey for a decade, I am practised at pondering the wisdom of visiting in times of Turkish trouble, regrettably frequent in this otherwise exceptional country, be it on account of Islamic or separatist terrorism, security clampdowns, civil unrest, attempted coups or refugee crises. I was quick to commiserate with my contacts in Turkey, many of whom had lost friends and colleagues, and were clearly in shock. Even so, he and others were clear that there was no raised danger to our guests from earthquake activity in either Istanbul or the volcanic hinterland region of Cappadocia; nor did they think our partners and suppliers there – hoteliers, drivers, guides and others – would thank us for cancelling out of respect. Even at a time like this, our Turkish hosts proved typically hospitable – as obliging, attentive and keen as ever to serve us. That may be because Turkey’s current turmoil is also economic, with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s unorthodox fiscal policies widely blamed for a rapidly devaluing lira and soaring prices, not least for food and other staples. And with Brits alone making 3.8 million visits to the country in 2022, many Turks are highly dependent on tourism for their livelihoods. Ersin, one of the reception staff at Istanbul’s Régie Ottoman hotel, was not only grateful that our group had come but admitted that he and his colleagues were worried at the prospect of mass cancellations in the months ahead. For some years we have run tours to Turkey, not only in the warmer months but in the winter when the queues, considerable for much of the year, are blissfully absent at major sites like Istanbul’s Topkapi Palace and Cappadocia’s Open Air Museum."

Mother and son went to a large central square in Kilis, a southern Turkish town that hugs the Syrian border and the nearby Bab al-Salam crossing into the north-west of a country they once called home. Surrounded by verdant fields of olive groves and farmland, Kilis nevertheless appeared to form a remarkable pocket of normality in the centre of a zone of physical devastation that touched every major city around it, particularly the Turkish trade hub of Gaziantep an hour north and the historical Syrian city of Aleppo just over an hour to the south. As the town reeled from the destruction around it, many of its Syrian residents like Naomi wondered about their futures amid promises by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to return 4.4 million Syrians to their war-scarred country. A leading Turkish business association, Türkonfed, estimated that the earthquake could cause losses of $84bn (£69bn) to the Turkish economy, and despite a lack of major infrastructure damage in the town, Kilis’ reliance on trade routes that crisscross southern Turkey and northern Syria could reshape the town once more due to the damage sustained by Gaziantep and other nearby trade hubs. The reopening of the crossing – as well as the Turkish government’s proclamations that 10,000 Syrians chose to return to Syria after the earthquake – marked potential new flashpoints for a place that was long considered a haven of coexistence, even if its Turkish residents kept their grievances to themselves. The dressmaker, who arrived in Kilis as a child and watched it transform into a tiny metropolis as he grew up, speaks Turkish and says he is in the process of applying for citizenship in a country that he is proud to call home. If he succeeds in his application, Naomi hopes to change his surname to Yildirim, to sound more Turkish. Naturalisation means he will evade Erdoğan’s promises to return home the millions of Syrians who have lived in Turkey for a decade, including to areas badly damaged by the tremors."

According to Reporters Without Borders, Turkey ranked 149 out of 180 for press freedom in 2022.

Large numbers of people in China (76%), India (77%) and Turkey (73%), for example, said they felt Russia was “stronger” or “as strong” as before the war. Similarly, many more (41% in China, 48% in Turkey and 54% in India) wanted the war to end as soon as possible, even if that meant Ukraine ceding territory, while just 23%, 27%, and 30% thought Ukraine should regain its land even at the cost of a longer conflict. Fewer than a quarter of those polled in China and Turkey, for example, and only 15% in Russia, believed the west was supporting Ukraine to defend its own security or democracy.

Millions of people who fled ruined cities across southern Turkey and northern Syria, which were both shaken violently by the two tremors on Monday evening, now fear for their lives in temporary shelters. The first 6.3-magnitude quake struck near the Turkish city of Antakya, which was all but destroyed by the 6 February quake and is largely uninhabitable. In southern Turkey’s disaster zone, two weeks of quakes and aftershocks have scythed a haphazard path, destroying some communities while seemingly sparing others. Two main hubs in southern Turkey – Antakya and Gaziantep – have been cited as cases in point, with the near annihilation of the former contrasted by locals to the nearly intact state of the latter. In advance of an election that could be held as early as May, the president of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, faces growing pressure to explain how so many buildings so easily collapsed, entombing tens of thousands of people who had been sleeping when the first quake struck at 4.17am. In the aftermath, a spotlight has been cast on the widespread provision of homes that did not meet earthquake standards, with increasing calls for construction standards to be enhanced in Turkey and developing countries around the world. “But the evidence of the recent catastrophic earthquakes in Turkey and Syria shows only too well that the principle is not the practice."

In Turkey alone, an estimated 1 million people are living in tents and temporary shelters, while at least 80,000 injured people are in hospital. There is widespread anger and frustration against the Turkish government. On Monday, a 6.4-magnitude earthquake and a second measuring 5.8 hit Turkey’s southern province of Hatay, terrifying those left in the region and killing at least three people. Imams in mosques around the globe have performed absentee funeral prayers for the dead in Turkey and Syria, many of whom could not receive full burial rites. Last week, Syria’s dictator, Bashar al-Assad, was persuaded to open two more border crossings with Turkey so more aid could reach the north-west, where 12 years of bitter fighting have complicated the international relief effort. The Turkish toll now far exceeds the 31,643 killed in a quake in 1939. And on Saturday, Ankara announced that it had ended rescue efforts in all but two of the hardest-hit provinces, with search and rescue teams still working in the cities of Antakya and Kahramanmaraş.

One person was reported dead in the town of Samandag in Hatay by Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority AFAD. The latest quakes, less powerful than the 7.8- and 7.5-magnitude earthquakes that tore a path of destruction through southern Turkey and northern Syria on 6 February, threaten yet more devastation in a region where many people have fled their destroyed homes for the safety of other towns and villages outside the quake zone. It was centred near the southern Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. Turkey’s disaster management agency AFAD said the epicentre of the larger quake was below the Defne district of Hatay, in a region where many have complained of a lacklustre government response to the first earthquakes. The mayor of Hatay, Lütfü Savaş, immediately raised concerns that the latest quakes had caused yet more destruction across the province, and potentially further loss of human life in a place already dealing with some of the worst devastation in Turkey. The death toll in Turkey from the quakes two weeks ago rose to 41,156 on Monday, AFAD said, and was expected to climb further, with 385,000 apartments known to have been destroyed or seriously damaged and many people still missing. At least 47,000 people are estimated to have died across Turkey and Syria. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said construction work on nearly 200,000 apartments in 11 earthquake-hit provinces of Turkey would begin next month. Hours earlier, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on a visit to Turkey that Washington would help “for as long as it takes” as rescue operations and aftershocks were winding down and the focus turned towards urgent shelter and reconstruction work."

Under domestic pressures and international politics, there is a stark disparity in the way international rescue, relief and rehabilitation aid has been delivered to thousands of Syrians in comparison with their peers deserving equal care and attention in Turkey. The latest twin earthquakes of 6.4 and 5.8 magnitude in Turkey is just another reminder of the power of nature beyond state boundaries, and that a humanitarian response must be without limitation. The Assad regime has only given the UN access to two border crossing entry points from Turkey for the thousands of earthquake victims, when much of the critical time to save lives has already been lost. Whenever there is tragedy – like the current one in Syria and Turkey – we feel the senseless curbs on humanitarian activities and then forget."

The total death toll now exceeds 46,000 – over 40,000 of whom are in Turkey. On Saturday, Turkey announced that it had ended rescue efforts in all but two of the hardest hit provinces, in the cities of Antakya and Kahramanmaraş. As time has gone on, shock around the disaster has turned into anger and frustration, with Turkish citizens accusing the government of evading accountability over poor building standards. I spoke to Dr Karabekir Akkoyunlu, a UK-based expert in Turkish politics and lecturer at SOAS University of London, about the impact the earthquake has had on Erdoğan’s chances for another term in office. “For instance, in the 2019 local elections, they managed to get the municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara out of the hands of the ruling party after 24 years, which was a huge setback for them.” Erdoğan’s falling popularity has, in large part, been because of Turkey’s weakening economy: the lira has been collapsing in value for years, recently hitting record lows against the dollar. And while inflation has fallen over the last two months, the average person in Turkey is unlikely to feel immediate relief as the country has consistently had some of the highest inflation rates in Europe – in October it reached a 24-year high of 85.5%. In October he unveiled what he called “the biggest social housing project in the history of the Turkish republic”, promising to build 500,000 new homes. “He started pulling these policies out of the bag even though they would obviously have huge costs for Turkey’s already empty state coffers,” says Akkoyunlu. Now, with a number of Turkish towns and cities reduced to rubble, the focus has moved back to what many are calling systemic corruption. While public opinion will change as the country starts to rebuild, and Erdoğan likely takes all the credit for getting Turkey back on its feet, the government will not be able to shake this crisis off, like it often has been able to in the past. This is perhaps why he has been pushing ahead with unconstitutional moves to delay the election, saying that Turkey cannot hold an election in these conditions."

The UK development minister, Andrew Mitchell, arrived in the Turkish city of Gaziantep on Sunday to inspect post earthquake aid projects funded by Britain, the cost of which amount to more than £34m.

However, refineries in India and Turkey have increased their imports from Russia since the start of the war and have been accused of providing a “back door” for Russian oil exports to be refined, re-badged and exported around the world. Analysis of data from commodity tracker Kpler by the non-profit group Global Witness found that Shell had imported more than 600,000 barrels of refined products into the Netherlands from Turkish refineries known to import Russian oil since 5 December. While it cannot be proved whether the products were definitely derived from Russian crude, Turkish refineries are importing vast quantities from Russia, which can then be immediately refined or blended with crude from other nations. The Global Witness study showed that in 2022 Turkey imported 143m barrels of crude from Russia, a 50% increase from 2021. One refinery dominated that trade – Star in Aliaga, on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast. The refinery is owned by the Turkish division of Azerbaijan’s state oil firm Socar. The Izmit and Aliaga refineries, owned by Tüpraş, the largest refinery company in Turkey, also handled Russian-origin crude. In a letter to the new Shell chief executive, Wael Sawan, seen by the Guardian, Ustenko acknowledged Shell had not broken any sanctions but said importing products from Turkish refineries “awash” with Russian oil “flies in the face of Shell’s pledge to withdraw from its involvement in Russian crude oil and petroleum products, and exploits a loophole in the EU sanctions regime”. Data shows that the EU imported 5m barrels of refined products from Turkey since 5 December, and 20m barrels from refineries that handle Russian oil during 2022. Vitol said: “Product exported from Turkish refineries is not Russian origin, according to all international regulations.”"

Just as pressing is the role that a permissive regulatory environment played in allowing developers to profit from building affordable homes for Turkey’s dwindling middle classes. Up to 75,000 buildings in the earthquake zone were granted such a reprieve, according to the Istanbul Union of Chambers of Engineers and Urban Planners. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s reign is deeply linked to his pledge of a construction boom after sweeping to power in 2003, in the aftermath of another deadly earthquake in 1999 which killed more than 17,000 people. In March 2019, a month before local elections, the Turkish government instituted the nationwide building amnesty on illegal construction, despite domestic engineers and architects warning that it risked citizens’ safety. The Turkish leader, who faces elections expected in May, promised a reconstruction campaign that he said would make cities livable again within a year. In one, called the Isia, a group of 39 Turkish Cypriots, visiting for a youth volleyball tournament, had been staying. One of those arrested was Mehmet Yaşar Coşkun who was detained at Istanbul airport suspected of attempting to flee to Montenegro. The sweep of arrests ensnared many far from the earthquake zone: contractor Hasan Alpargün was arrested in the Turkish-controlled part of the Cypriot capital Nicosia after prosecutors accused him of “reckless murder and causing injury”. Until then, the people of Adıyaman and much of south-eastern Turkey will be forced to pick up the pieces. “The graveyards are full,” said Ergün Demiray, the hospitality director of the Shaya group, which runs the Shake Shack and Starbucks franchises in Turkey."

On 5 February, Atsu came on as a substitute and scored the winning goal against Kasimpasa, the day before two fatal earthquakes struck south-eastern Turkey. In a statement, Everton said: “We are deeply saddened by today’s news that Christian Atsu has been found dead following the earthquake in Turkey earlier this month.

Mosques around the world performed absentee funeral prayers for the dead in Turkey and Syria, many of whom could not receive full burial rites given the enormity of the disaster. Hakan Yasinoglu, in his 40s, was rescued in the southern province of Hatay, 278 hours after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck in the dead of night on 6 February, the Istanbul fire brigade said. Earlier, Osman Halebiye, 14, and Mustafa Avci, 34, were saved in Turkey’s historic city of Antakya. The death toll in Turkey now stands at 39,672, making it the worst disaster in the country’s modern history. Neither Turkey nor Syria have said how many people are still missing after the quake. For families still waiting to retrieve relatives in Turkey, there is growing anger over what they see as corrupt building practices and deeply flawed urban development that resulted in thousands of homes and businesses disintegrating. Club manager Fatih İlek revealed on Friday that he had been scheduled to leave Turkey hours before the quake hit, but decided to stay after scoring an important goal for his team."

A luxury block built in 2013 on the outskirts of the city of Antakya, in Turkey’s southern Hatay province, it included flats that sold for up to £132,000, far more expensive than anything else in the area. The total destruction of the Renaissance quickly came to embody the tension between the Turkish authorities and the public. While the state has blamed corruption among individual developers and building contractors, furious relatives of the more than 36,000 dead in Turkey, like those who gathered outside the Renaissance for over a week, say a broader system enabled the corrupt building practices that caused the luxury apartment block to fall. Less than a week after the Renaissance’s collapse, its developer, Mehmet Yaşar Coşkun, was arrested in Istanbul airport, accused of trying to flee. At least 110 other building contractors and developers were arrested in Turkey, some accused of “reckless manslaughter and building code violations”. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who swept to power in 2003 promising a nationwide construction boom to rebuild the country after the deadly earthquake of 1999, which killed more than 17,000 people, has rebuffed suggestions of institutional corruption in Turkey’s construction sector. “There is a chain of responsibility in the construction process, including those in local and central government,” said Eyüp Muhcu, general secretary of Turkey’s Chamber of Architects."

Similar refrains come from across southern Turkey as residents try to salvage what remains of their families and belongings. But permissive regulatory environments that facilitated the rapid construction of lower-quality structures are in the sights of survivors, who are calling on Ankara to explain how such homes were allowed to be built. Turkey has ordered the arrest of more than 100 developers and builders, but officials who authorised the construction have so far escaped. Meanwhile, the UN has announced an appeal for $1bn in relief funds for victims in southern Turkey, where, as well as almost 37,000 deaths, up to a million people have been displaced by what the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said was the biggest ever natural disaster on Nato soil. Another 1 million Syrian residents of Turkey are believed to have been affected by the disaster, with many having fallen between the cracks of Turkey, which is caring for its citizens, and the UN, which has been roundly criticised for its slow response. “The Turkish government gave Syrians with temporary protection a permission to go to north-west Syria for three months at least and a maximum of six months, so many Syrians thought they have a better chance of surviving in the next few months at least in Syria,” said Labib al-Nahhas, the head of diplomatic outreach at the Syrian Association for Citizens’ Dignity. Up to 2,300 bodies have been returned to Syria from southern Turkey, while 2,800 Syrian citizens have voluntarily gone back through the Bab al-Hawa crossing. “Syrians are afraid that the absence of any real effort from the UN to help them rebuild their lives in south Turkey is a prelude to a forced return to regime areas,” Nahhas said. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development said on Thursday that the economic toll of the quake in Turkey could reach $25bn, equating to 2.5% of the country’s GDP."

Architect Mücella Yapıcı, lawyer Can Atalay and urban planner Tayfun Kahraman, all prominent members of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Architects and Engineers (TMMOB) and longstanding critics of the AKP government, have all been thrown in jail on bogus conspiracy charges.

As a UN aid convoy entered stricken north-west Syria through a new crossing, the combined death toll rose to nearly 38,000, including 31,974 in Turkey and at least 5,714 in rebel-held and government-controlled Syria – a figure that is expected to continue to increase. Among those recovered on Tuesday was Muhammed Cafer, 18, who could be seen moving his fingers as he was lifted from rubble in Kahramanmaraş, Turkey. Turkey’s TRT Haber reported a 35-year-old woman had also been pulled alive from the ruins of a block of flats in the southern Hatay province, 205 hours after the 7.8-magnitude quake, which was followed by a powerful aftershock, struck early on Monday. At a field hospital in Antakya, Turkey, one doctor, Yilmaz Aydin, told Agence France-Presse it was now “a miracle to find a patient still alive”, and that those who were rescued would be “in a more critical condition. Across swaths of southern Turkey, whole cities have become ghost towns after most of their residents fled. Kluge said three charter flights with emergency medical kits had been dispatched to Syria and Turkey – enough to treat 400,000 people – and 22 teams from 19 countries deployed in the largest operation of its kind in the organisation’s 75-year history. The organisation’s secretary general, António Guterres, added that the world body was in the “final stages” of a similar appeal for Turkey. In Turkey alone, an estimated 1 million people are living in tents and temporary shelters, while at least 80,000 people have been hospitalised.

Search and rescue teams began to wind down their work on Monday as hopes of finding anyone alive faded, but there were cheers in Turkish cities when people were freed after seven days under the rubble, including a young girl named Miray in Adıyaman and a 12-year-old boy named Kaan in southern Hatay province. “I have a very strong feeling we are going to get them,” said Burcu Baldauf, the head of the Turkish voluntary healthcare team.

As public anger continued to mount in Turkey at the scale of the destruction and the slow pace of rescue efforts, the arrests are likely to be seen as an attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who faces tough elections in May, to deflect blame. Turkey’s vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said on Sunday that authorities had identified 131 people suspected of being responsible for the collapse of some of the thousands of buildings flattened, and that detention orders had been issued for 113 of them.

Ankara’s slow response to the disaster, however, played a large part in bringing Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP) to power: the newly formed party won elections in 2002 by an overwhelming majority, promising transparency and to rebuild the economy, ruined by a stock market crash. Nearly 24 years later, after Monday’s even deadlier earthquake and aftershocks, people across Turkey are searching not just for missing loved ones but also for answers. But with nearly 30,000 people now dead in Turkey alone – a number that continues to rise – and more than 1 million people left homeless, it is becoming clearer that endemic corruption and lax enforcement of building codes have exacerbated the crisis. Erdoğan, now the president, made construction the engine of the Turkish economy; reliance on cheap foreign credit funded new motorways, hospitals and residential and commercial towers all over the country until the Turkish lira collapsed in 2018. On paper, Turkish building safety standards are among the best in the world, and they are regularly updated with specific rules for earthquake-prone regions. But Turkish and international geologists, urban planners, architects and earthquake response specialists warned for years that even many modern structures across the country constituted “rubble in waiting” because building codes had not been properly followed. At the same time, the population in many of the worst-hit areas of Turkey has increased in the last decade due to an influx of millions of refugees from neighbouring Syria fleeing civil war. The Turkish government has periodically held so-called “construction amnesties” since the 1960s, in which construction companies and building owners have had lacking safety certification waived for a fee – a policy that is believed to have generated billions of lira. The last amnesty was in 2018, and just a few days before the latest earthquakes struck, Turkish media reported that another was due to be discussed in the cash-strapped Turkish parliament. In the 10 affected provinces of Turkey, up to 75,000 buildings were granted such amnesties over the years, according to Pelin Pınar Giritlioğlu, the head of the Istanbul engineering and architecture union chambers."

Dozens of countries, including Turkey’s old foe, Greece, swiftly provided assistance. How this urgent challenge is met will increasingly depend on the Turkish and Syrian governments, neither of whose initial performance has impressed. In shattered Turkish cities such as Antakya, ancient capital of Hatay province, it is difficult to see how rebuilding can even begin. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, has numerous questions to answer, too, over the speed and effectiveness of his government’s response and over negligent official regulation, planning, enforcement and “amnesty” rules that permitted the construction of thousands of substandard apartment and office blocks, schools and hospitals. Erdoğan styles himself Turkey’s paramount leader. Now, the focus, domestic and international, must be on reaching and caring for survivors and victims in both Turkey and Syria."

Many of those who did arrive to help distribute food, medicine and aid were sent by an Istanbul municipality linked to the country’s largest opposition party, amid little suggestion of government help to clear piles of rubble so high that it blocked the street in many places. Residents said that the central government in Ankara had long neglected Hatay province, a fertile and verdant strip of land filled with olive groves and citrus trees bordered by Syria’s Idlib province on one side and the Mediterranean sea on the other.

A central reason is the damage to the UN’s own hub in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near the epicentre of the earthquake. “Co-ordination with Turkish authorities is incredibly difficult because they’re all consumed by their own crisis.” Aid experts are calling for the rapid opening of additional crossings on the Turkey-Syria border. “They need your help now” says Metro, showing another child being pulled from the earthquake rubble in Turkey."

Six trucks passed through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing from Turkey carrying tents and hygiene products, as Turkey said it was working to open two more border crossings with Syria to allow in more humanitarian aid. He said it faced the same situation as Turkey but without any government support. In Turkey, a survivor in the city of Antakya called for the government to evacuate people from devastated areas. Just one border crossing, in Turkey’s southern Hatay province, is open for transporting life-saving aid to rebel-held regions of Syria under the authorisation of the UN security council. Humanitarian aid for rebel-held areas usually arrives through Turkey via a cross-border mechanism created in 2014 by a security council resolution. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said late on Wednesday: “There is damage to some roads on the Syrian side of the border. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was scheduled to travel to the quake-hit provinces of Gaziantep, Osmaniye and Kilis on Thursday amid ongoing criticism that the government’s response has been too slow. According to the Turkish disaster management agency, more than 110,000 rescue personnel were now taking part in the effort and more than 5,500 vehicles including tractors, cranes, bulldozers and excavators had been shipped. He said the government would give 10,000 Turkish lira (£435/$530) to affected families."

The combined death toll in Turkey and Syria from Monday’s devastating earthquake rose to at least 21,o00 after officials and medics in Turkey said 17,674 people had died in the country and figures published by the Syrian White Helmets group said 3,377 people had died in Syria. Aid has been announced for Turkey and Syria. The World Bank will provide $1.78bn to Turkey. Meanwhile the US will send $85m (£70.1m) in aid for Turkey and Syria. Immediate assistance of $780m (£643m) will be offered via Contingent Emergency Response Components from two existing projects in Turkey, said the bank. Countries including France and Germany have also sent money and support, as has Greece, which has had long-term disputes with Turkey. At least 28,044 people have been evacuated from Kahramanmaraş, one of the southern Turkish provinces hardest hit by Monday’s earthquake, including 23,437 by air and 4,607 by road and rail, Turkey’s disaster management agency said. Turkey’s disaster management agency, AHAD, said it has recorded almost 650 aftershocks since two earthquakes – 7.8 and 7.6 in magnitude – struck, making rescue efforts even more difficult and dangerous as emergency teams comb through severely weakened buildings. The UN will dispatch its aid chief, Martin Griffiths, to Gaziantep, in Turkey, and Aleppo and Damascus, in Syria, this weekend.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s car glistened in the sunlight as the Turkish president passed citizens burning fires to keep warm in the freezing cold among towering piles of rubble that were once their homes. Erdoğan limited his interactions with the public in Pazarcık, instead driving directly to the local police headquarters to discuss the aftermath of the multiple massive tremors that left a trail of destruction over 10 Turkish provinces and across northern Syria, trapping people underneath collapsed buildings and killing more than 20,000. People who lined the streets of Pazarcık sobbing as they waited to see their dead relatives pulled from the rubble – rather than to catch a glimpse of the president’s motorcade – disagreed, as did those in other badly hit towns, who shouted angrily at Turkey’s infrastructure minister and a local official during a visit. Across southern Turkey – areas traditionally considered bastions of support for the president and his Justice and Development party (AKP) – displaced citizens surviving in freezing conditions complained openly about delays and sleeping in the cold despite the state’s promises . The İzmit earthquake, which destroyed part of Istanbul and loomed large over Turkey’s recent history as the country’s largest natural disaster until this week, prompted the introduction of a tax to provide economic support after disasters, which experts estimated to total about £3.8bn – raising questions from opposition politicians as to how that money has been spent in the years since. Instead, the message from the presidential palace appears to be one born of fear and control in the quake’s aftermath, amid reports that Turkey briefly blocked Twitter, which citizens had been using to locate lost loved ones amid the rubble. After touring areas destroyed by the quake and its aftershocks, Erdoğan described the state of emergency allowing him to bypass the rule of law in the 10 affected regions as “an opportunity to foil moneylenders and seditious groups who abuse due process in Turkey”. “The argument that Turkey needs an effective if autocratic leader falls apart if people say the state isn’t there when they need it,” he said."

Making his first visit to Turkey’s worst-affected region since the 7.8- and 7.5-magnitude quakes hit within hours of each other, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan acknowledged early problems with Turkey’s response but said it was now working well. Many Turks have complained of a lack of equipment and support as they waited helplessly next to the rubble of their apartment blocks, unable to rescue relatives and neighbours trapped inside despite sometimes hearing cries for help. Officials have confirmed 12,391 people died in Turkey in the aftermath of the twin quakes. Erdoğan, wary of the impact of any perception his government was failing in its response to Turkey’s most deadly quake since 1939, has declared a state of emergency in the areas concerned and sent in troops to help. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of Turkey’s main opposition party, on Wednesday accused the government of failing to cooperate with local authorities and weakening non-governmental organisations that could help. Survivors in southern Turkey and north-west Syria, meanwhile, spent a second night in the freezing cold, many taking refuge in their cars or under blankets in the streets, fearful of going back into potentially seriously weakened buildings. The World Health Organization (WHO), which has previously said up to 23 million people may be affected by the quakes, on Wednesday announced it was sending a high-level delegation to coordinate its response in both countries, as well as three flights with medical supplies, one of which is already on its way to Istanbul. In Turkey, the WHO representative Batyr Berdyklychev said more than 53,000 people were injured. In many parts of Turkey hit by the quakes, shops were closed and there was no heat because gas pipes had been shut to avoid explosions. Authorities have said about 13.5 million people have been affected in Turkey. The EU is also sending an initial €3m in aid to Turkey."

Investors were disenchanted with Turkey before the earthquake after a series of statements from president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government that it would resist after the economic policies adopted by the big industrialised economies. The Turkish lira collapsed after Erdoğan forced the central bank to cut rates to spur growth as the country came out of the Covid-19 pandemic. Turkey’s annual inflation rate fell sharply in December, but only to 66.8% from 84% in the previous month before falling again in January to 58%. A Reuters poll found that most City economists believe inflation will still be as high as 43.2% by the end of 2023, double the level predicted by the finance ministry in Ankara. Before the earthquake, Turkey was expected to be forced to seek external funds to finance its growing current account deficit. The pressure from investors for a rise in interest rates – which is the price they demand for repatriating their funds back to Istanbul – is likely to become more intense after the earthquake. Shabbir Ansari, a senior insurance analyst at GlobalData, said: “The preliminary estimate of economic loss due to the current catastrophic event is more than $1bn, and it will take years for Turkish insurers to settle the insured losses. He said insurers in Turkey were already reeling under the pressure of high inflation that affected their profitability. As a result, Turkish property insurers are expected to register underwriting losses in 2023 and 2024,” he added. The benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 Index has lost 16% this week, shedding almost $35bn from share values. Turkish stocks, which are this year’s worst performers globally, entered a technical bear market on Tuesday after falling more than 20% from their January high."

Criticism continued to mount over what many in Turkey described as a slow and inadequate response to the disaster, with much anger also focused on an “earthquake tax” levied by the Turkish government more than two decades ago. The estimated 88bn lira (£3.8bn) levy, raised in 1999 after more than 17,000 people were killed in another powerful quake in north-western Turkey, was intended to be spent on disaster prevention and better emergency services, but little information is available about how it has been used. People in remote towns in southern Turkey described how relief efforts were stretched to breaking point, amid the destruction that spanned a border region almost 650 miles long. Many Turks vented their anger online over what they said was a negligent emergency response in the southernmost province of Hatay, complaining that rescue efforts had failed to reach the area. In Hatay, the quake levelled government buildings including the local chapter of Turkey’s disaster relief agency, the AFAD. Murat Harun Öngören, a coordinator with Akut, Turkey’s largest civil society aid and rescue organisation, said efforts to reach those affected across southern Turkey had been severely impeded by the cold weather and icy conditions, as well as the sheer size of the affected area."

Murat Harun Öngören, a coordinator with AKUT, Turkey’s largest civil society aid and rescue organisation, said efforts to reach those affected across southern Turkey had been severely impeded by the cold weather and icy conditions – as well as the sheer size of the affected area. Many Turks vented their anger online over what they said was a negligent emergency response in the southern-most province of Hatay, with many complaining that rescue efforts had failed to reach the area. In Hatay, the quake levelled multiple government buildings including the local chapter of Turkey’s disaster relief agency, the AFAD. Turkey said it had received offers of aid from 45 governments ranging from Kuwait to India to Russia."

Turkey has introduced new building codes, requiring new construction to be earthquake resilient, not least following the 1999 Izmit earthquake in which over 17,000 people died, but these have often been loosely enforced in a country where over half of all buildings were put up illegally. Turkey went through the terrible 1999 Izmit earthquake […] Turkey had modern building codes within a few years of that earthquake. After a quake in 2011 in which hundreds died, Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, blamed poor construction for the high death toll, saying: “Municipalities, constructors and supervisors should now see that their negligence amounts to murder.” Architects and urban planners in the country have long warned that building codes related to seismic activity are insufficiently enforced and have been undermined by a controversial amnesty for illegal construction – introduced by Erdoğan’s own government – that netted Turkey some $3bn in revenues. “This extraordinary devastation is perpetuated by the persistence in repeating faulty urban policies and politically charged decisions like the 2018 zoning amnesty law,” said Prof Pelin Pinar Giritlioğlu, president of the Istanbul branch of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects. At the time of the amnesty, Turkey’s building experts warned that retrospectively licensing illegal buildings for a fee would have fatal consequences. “It will mean transforming our cities, notably Istanbul, into graveyards and result in coffins emerging from our homes,” said Cemal Gökçe, the chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers in 2019."

Turkish vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said 3,294 search and rescue personnel had reached Turkey from abroad, adding: “Over 70 countries have made requests, 14 of them are actually in the field.” The EU said it had mobilised 27 search and rescue and medical teams, more than 1,150 rescue workers and 70 search and rescue dogs from 19 European countries. But he said more crossing points from Turkey into northern Syria needed to be opened. “The areas worst affected by the earthquake inside Syria look to be run by the Turkish-controlled opposition and not by the Syrian government,” said Mark Lowcock, the former head of UN humanitarian affairs. “It is going to require Turkish acquiescence to get aid into those areas. Sabbagh was asked whether Syria would agree to allow the UN to deliver aid through other crossing points from Turkey, if it was feasible. The flow of UN aid from Turkey to north-west Syria has been temporarily halted due to damage to roads and other logistical issues related to the earthquake that struck the two countries on Monday, a UN spokesperson said. There is a wider concern that Turkey, facing larger loss of life, is focused understandably on saving its own citizens and will not be able to prioritise help into areas of Syria where forces that it backs have been operating."

A massive rescue effort is underway, with 13,000 more rescue workers, including volunteers, on their way from Istanbul. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that it was the worst disaster to hit the country since 1939, and in Syria, a volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group, Ismail Alabdullah, said: “We are used to digging people out of the rubble but this is different … There is nothing left, nothing at all.” For today’s newsletter, Ruth Michaelson, who has been covering the disaster for the Guardian from Istanbul, explains the confluence of factors that made it such a catastrophe. When the sun rose, it revealed a picture of devastation across south-eastern Turkey and north-western Syria. Within half an hour of the quake hitting, the governor of the Turkish city of Osmaniye had confirmed five deaths. “Turkey and Syria have suffered catastrophic earthquakes multiple times in living memory,” said Ruth Michaelson (who you can also hear on this morning’s episode of Today in Focus). “Everybody here remembers 1999 [when a quake hit Istanbul and killed 17,000]. “Even on Turkish TV news, you could see people trembling as they hit, watching the building quake, and trying to work out the right thing to do,” Ruth said. There have already been warnings in recent weeks that a snowstorm across Syria and parts of Turkey had left millions of displaced people at risk of freezing to death. In Turkey, Ruth said, “the problem of how to deal with earthquakes is something every government knows they have to be on top of. Even in Istanbul, which was unaffected this time, concerns over unregulated development and ageing building stock prompted warnings in 2020 that a major earthquake could leave 10% of the city’s 15m residents homeless. In a 2020 piece for catastrophe modelling firm Temblor, Istanbul-based seismologist Haluk Eyidoğan warned that in the south-east of Turkey, “stone masonry and adobe masonry structures in rural areas are weak, and the so-called reinforced concrete carcass multi-storey buildings are demolished in cities”."

Turkey’s Andalou Agency reports that a woman has been rescued after 22 hours stuck under the rubble: Today humanitarian aid in rebel-held areas usually arrives through Turkey, thanks to a cross-border mechanism created in 2014 by a UN security council resolution. The military police prison in the town of Rajo near the Turkish border holds about 2,000 inmates, with about 1,300 of them suspected to be IS fighters, said the source. “After the earthquake struck, Rajo was affected and inmates started to mutiny and took control of parts of the prison,” said the official at Rajo jail, which is controlled by pro-Turkish factions.

By the early evening, the death toll in Turkey stood at 2,921, the the country’s emergency services said, and more than 14,483 people were recorded as injured. Yunus Sezer, who heads Turkey’s disaster relief agency AFAD, said nearly 15,000 search and rescue personnel had been deployed to the region. The quake struck at 4.17am local time at a depth of about 11 miles (18km) near the Turkish city of Gaziantep, which is home to about 2 million people, the US Geological Survey said. In some places around southeast Turkey, survivors could be heard screaming from beneath collapsed buildings, the Associated Press reported. Television images from Turkey showed shocked people standing in the snow in their pyjamas, watching rescuers dig through the debris of damaged homes. Turkey is in one of the world’s most active earthquake zones, with land stretching over the Anatolian faultline in the north of the country that has caused large and destructive tremors. İzmit and the surrounding Kocaeli region, close to Istanbul, were rocked by a 7.4-magnitude earthquake in 1999, the worst to hit Turkey in decades. That quake killed more than 17,000 people, including at least 1,000 in Istanbul, amid widespread destruction. He added: “I was in Istanbul when the big earthquake hit in 1999; this is was more severe than that.” He broke off as another aftershock hit. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, the biggest humanitarian organisation in Turkey and part of the International Red Cross, said the group had mobilised resources for the region and urged people to evacuate damaged homes.

Among the victims will be some of the 4 million Syrians who fled the war; many have been living in southern Turkey, often in overcrowded conditions. Turkey faces an immense challenge. Though conflict in Syria has faded from international attention, the complex regional struggle – not only of the regime against rebels, but of Turkey against Kurdish groups and Israel against Iranian-linked targets – continues to claim lives in the north and there are fears it could escalate. The mandate for Syria cross-border aid via Turkey has, thankfully, been extended until July. Ankara’s attempts to accelerate the return of Syrian refugees would exacerbate the situation were they to continue."

The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said preliminary data showed the second large quake measured 7.7 magnitude, and was 42 miles (67km) north-east of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, at a depth of 2,000 metres. The partial destruction of a Roman-era castle in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near where the first quake had its epicentre, led to fears that the earthquakes may have damaged other priceless monuments in Turkey and Syria, areas rich in cultural heritage. Turkey’s armed forces set up an air corridor to enable search-and-rescue teams to reach the zone affected. Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant, which is under construction, was not damaged by the earthquake, an official from the Russian company building the plant said. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was concerned about areas in Turkey from which there had been no news since the earthquake. In 1999, a tremor of similar magnitude to today’s quakes in Turkey devastated İzmit, killing more than 17,000. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has described Monday as the worst disaster for the country since 1939, when an earthquake killed more than 32,000 people and injured more than 100,000.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who is facing an election in a few months, said offers of aid to Turkey had come from 45 countries ranging from Kuwait to Israel, Russia and the UK. By Monday afternoon the number of dead in northern Syria had reached 840, about a half of the fast-rising death toll in Turkey of 1,541. Aid agencies reported that some of the roads from Turkey into Syria were blocked, including the main cross border crossing used by international aid agencies. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US was already assessing its comprehensive response options, “and had directed my team to remain in close contact with our Turkish allies and our humanitarian partners in the coming days to determine what the region needs”. Italy and Hungary have offered their rescue teams to Turkey as well.” Soldiers from Azerbaijan were the fist to arrive in Turkey to offer practical support sending 400 fully equipped soldiers.

As Sweden holds the EU presidency we are going to reach out to the Turkish foreign affairs minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, and to Syria for the coordination of EU efforts to aid these countries in this disaster.” Sweden has been at loggerheads with Turkey over Erdoğan’s refusal to allow it into Nato. Last month, the UN security council agreed to allow aid into north-west Syria from Turkey across one border crossing, at Bab al-Hawa. “The areas worst affected by the earthquake inside Syria look to be run by the Turkish-controlled opposition and not by the Syrian government,” said Mark Lowcock, the former head of UN humanitarian affairs. “It is going to require Turkish acquiescence to get aid into those areas.

It’s time to play hardball,5 Feb 2023 09.00 CET,"That Turkey is a “vital strategic ally” of the west is the sort of truism on which people such as Joe Biden and Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, are raised. What if Turkey’s leader, exploiting this notion, betrays western interests in a pretence of partnership? Turkey wields significant influence at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Turkey’s reliability and usefulness as a trusted western ally is almost at an end. As the most important Turkish elections in a generation move towards a febrile climax in May, and as the western democracies contemplate critical choices in Ukraine, over Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and in Iran, Syria and Israel-Palestine, these dilemmas boil down to one basic question: is it time to admit that two-faced Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is no friend of the west – and punish him accordingly? Using Turkey’s Nato membership for domestic political ends is a typical Erdoğan gambit. Turkey’s trade with Russia grew by nearly 200% in the six months after the invasion, including higher energy imports. Human rights abuses aside, Erdoğan has made a huge mess of Turkey’s economy. And if Erdoğan has his way, he will soon be joined by Ekrem İmamoğlu, Istanbul’s popular mayor and a leading light of the main CHP (Republican People’s party) opposition. US senators suggest that Ankara may be denied F-16 fighter jets promised by Biden if it continues to sabotage Nato. They should remind Erdoğan that Nato is a community of values as well as rules; welcome Sweden and Finland into the alliance via a vote of all 30 members; and suspend Turkey’s membership, if necessary by amending the North Atlantic treaty. Turkey inhabits a rough neighbourhood. But Turkey is not indispensable. If need be, the western democracies can live safely without it – until that happy day dawns when Ankara’s cantankerous sultan is finally defenestrated and debagged.

Ankara has refused to ratify the two countries’ Nato membership bids, primarily because of Sweden’s refusal to extradite dozens of suspects that Ankara links to outlawed Kurdish fighters and a failed 2016 coup attempt. Sweden has a bigger Kurdish diaspora than Finland and a more serious dispute with Ankara. Turkey has also reacted with fury to a decision by the Swedish police to allow a protest at which a far-right extremist burned a copy of the Qur’an outside the Turkish embassy in Stockholm earlier this month. Following those incidents, Ankara last week suspended the two countries’ Nato accession talks. But Haavisto, who said he had held talks with his Turkish counterpart after Erdoğan’s remarks, rejected that option. “President Erdoğan’s statement proves that there is a positive will in Turkey to advance the Nato process quickly if needed,” Haavisto added. So far, Turkey and Hungary are the only countries holding out."

Often seen as a frozen conflict in which neither set of politicians can shed their grievances or memories, the fate of the island, divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion to protect Turks on the island from the Greek military junta, has fallen down diplomats’ priority lists. Tatar, a rightwing nationalist elected in 2020 with the direct support of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, claims to be trying to change that. He has broken from previous Turkish Cypriot policy by proposing a two-state solution in which the two sides of the island would remain permanently divided with equal sovereign status. Tatar’s critics say his two-state plan is a nonstarter and instead of giving Turkish Cypriots greater sovereignty, his strategy risks turning the isolated north of Cyprus in effect into an economic colony of Ankara, something that will eventually threaten the north’s prized secular status. Tatar admitted that if the international community did not engage with his plan and lift the embargo on the north to open up, the north would be forced to integrate even more closely with Ankara. “Obviously if there is no agreement, in the long run we will have more and more Turkish influence on the island because we will over time become more and more dependent on Turkey,” he said. His “republic” already receives at least €270m a year from Ankara. Yet at the same time, Turks and Russians pour into the north to gamble, albeit in vast subterranean and money-spinning all-night casinos operating in the basements of luxury hotels. Tatar sees Turkey as the motherland. “Whenever we have been kicked around or suffered, Turkey always came to save us,” he said. “Turkey sacrificed her own children for our security. We feel part of the Turkish race."

The exploit has sparked criticism across the Islamic world and deepened a stand off with Turkey over Sweden’s bid to join Nato, which requires the approval of all 30 member countries. “Those who allow such blasphemy in front of our embassy can no longer expect our support for their Nato membership,” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said in response to the book burning. Despite calls by Sweden to restart trilateral talks with Turkey and fellow applicant, Finland, on their Nato bids, Turkey’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it would be “meaningless” to hold further discussions. On Friday, Turkey also summoned the Danish ambassador, and accused Denmark of endorsing a “hate crime”. Paludan told local media that he carried out the action because “some Swedes would like me to burn a Qur’an in front of the Turkish embassy”. Finland and Sweden last year began trilateral talks with Turkey aimed at overcoming Ankara’s doubts about their Nato membership. Sweden’s government has said it has been doing exactly what was promised to strengthen its counter-terrorism legislation, but Turkey is demanding more, including the extradition of 130 people it deems terrorists."

Saturday’s protest followed similar scenes in Sweden earlier this month when Kurdish protesters hung an effigy of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan from a lamp-post. “But Sweden will respect the agreement that exists between Sweden, Finland and Turkey regarding our Nato membership,” he added. Ankara has previously said Sweden in particular must first take a clearer stance against groups it sees as terrorists, mainly Kurdish militants and a group it blames for a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. Turkey and Hungary are the only Nato members not to have ratified the Sweden and Finland’s historic decision to break their tradition of military non-alignment. “Ultimately, this is a decision and consensus that Finland and Sweden are going to have to reach with Turkey,” Price said.

The Turkey to Italy route was established by a criminal network of Turkish smugglers as an alternative to the long Balkans overland route to the EU, in part in response to pushbacks, typically using small fast yachts, most often stolen or rented. About 11,000 migrants arrived on the Italian coasts of Puglia, Calabria and Sicily in 2021 from the Turkish ports of Izmir, Bodrum and Çanakkale. But since the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the number of Ukrainians recruited by Turkish smugglers has been decreasing. “Ukrainians have been fundamental for the arrival of people departing from Turkey, being expert sailors who know how to handle a boat,” the report says. Turkish gangs have instead begun training asylum seekers to pilot boats, recruiting Turkish sailors and hiring ever-increasing numbers of Russian citizens and others from former Soviet republics."

The protest in Stockholm, which took place under heavy police protection in front of Turkey’s embassy, gathered about 100 people and a crowd of reporters, Agence France-Presse reported. A day prior, Turkey’s foreign ministry summoned Sweden’s ambassador over the permission granted to Paludan’s protest. It was the second time Sweden’s ambassador to Turkey has been summoned this month, after having had to answer for a 12 January stunt during which a Kurdish group hung an effigy of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Stockholm. Earlier on Saturday, Ankara cancelled a 27 January visit by Sweden’s defence minister, Pål Jonson, intended to be a discussion about Turkey’s refusal to ratify Sweden’s Nato accession. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said the meeting was cancelled because it “has lost its significance and meaning”. Prior to Paludan’s event on Saturday, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, called it a “hate crime” that could not be characterised as freedom of expression, and asked Sweden not to allow the “vile act” to take place. Turkey has proved to be an obstacle to Sweden and Finland’s historic application for Nato membership after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which marked a reversal of the Nordic countries’ decades of neutrality. Sweden and Finland have gained the approval of 28 Nato members so far, bar Hungary and Turkey. But Turkey is still holding back, demanding the extradition of people in Sweden it claims to have links to the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU and the US – or to banned cleric Fethullah Gülen."

A key general election in Turkey is expected before June, in which Erdoğan is expected to face a six-party opposition coalition at the ballot box, seeking to challenge his campaign to extend his rule into a third decade. Only Turkey and Hungary, two nations that maintained ties with Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have stalled on the parliamentary votes required to approve Finland and Sweden’s accession, although the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said late last year that Hungary’s parliament would vote on the move in February. Ankara has been under increasing pressure from Swedish and Finnish officials as well as the Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, to approve the accession since the three countries signed a trilateral memorandum during a Nato summit in Madrid last June. The two Nordic countries agreed to address security concerns raised by Turkey, namely the presence of Kurdish organisations in Sweden that Ankara claims have links to the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey, the EU and Washington have designated a terrorist group. Both Nordic nations lifted restrictions on weapons exports to Ankara, and Sweden amended its constitution to toughen domestic anti-terror laws. Meanwhile, Turkey has pushed for Sweden to extradite a list of people it claims have links to either the PKK or the banned cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Ankara accuses of masterminding a coup attempt in 2016, including a journalist whose extradition was recently blocked by a Swedish court. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, told a domestic security conference earlier this month that Stockholm would be unable to meet all of Turkey’s demands. “Turkey confirms that we have done what we said we would do. So the decision is now with Turkey,” he said. “Finland and Sweden have delivered on their commitment to Turkey,” Stoltenberg told a press conference last November, after talks with the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu."

His words did little to calm anger in Turkey, which summoned Sweden’s ambassador to Ankara to voice its anger. “Our expectation – that the perpetrators of the incident need to be identified, the necessary processes be carried out and Sweden uphold its promises – was emphasised,” a Turkish source told Reuters. While 28 out of 30 Nato members have ratified their bids, Hungary and Turkey have not, with the latter likely to prove the biggest hurdle. Ankara has so far refused to ratify the applications unless the two countries do more to clamp down on Kurdish groups it regards as terrorists. Only a day before the latest row, Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, had said talks with Ankara were “going very well”. Kristersson said “we are proceeding in a good way” on a trilateral memo between Turkey, Sweden and Finland, but declined to give a date on membership entry. Kristersson said there were “different opinions” with Turkey on what needed to be done for Stockholm to join the military alliance, but conceded there had been a gap in Sweden’s counter-terrorism laws. “We are showing Turkey that we are doing exactly what we promised to do, not least in the field of fighting terrorism,” he told reporters in Stockholm on Wednesday. “I think that has been one of the core tasks: to strengthen the Swedish legislation on counter-terrorism, to recognise the fact that activities on Swedish soil can be dangerous to other countries … Recognising the fact that Turkey has been one of the countries hurt most by terrorism.” Kristersson said Turkey sometimes named people it wanted to extradite from Sweden, but that such decisions were the responsibility of Sweden’s courts, not its government."

But he said “Turkey” was not forbidden when “in furtherance of broader public understanding” as it is “more widely understood by the American public”. Turks have long been upset by cartoons and other references that associate their country’s name in English with the bird – believed to be so named because the British thought the species, indigenous to North America, came from the east. In a recent article, Turkish public broadcaster TRT World noted that a “turkey” can also be slang for a “stupid or silly person”. “Type ‘Turkey’ into Google, and you will get a muddled set of images, articles and dictionary definitions that conflate the country with Meleagris – otherwise known as the turkey, a large bird native to North America – which is famous for being served on Christmas menus or Thanksgiving dinners,” it said.

The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, and the head of the country’s national intelligence organisation (MIT), Hakan Fidan, met the Syrian defence minister, Ali Mahmoud Abbas, and the notorious spy chief Ali Mamlouk in Moscow, in a meeting attended by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. The Turkish defence ministry outlined how the group discussed “the Syrian crisis, the refugee problem”, and coordination regarding efforts to “combat all terrorist organisations in Syria”. The Moscow meeting represents a marked shift in Turkish policy as Ankara has supported and trained some Syrian rebel groups. Turkish territory along its southern border with Syria provided vital lifelines for rebels during the early stages of the Syrian civil war, and formed an essential exit point for millions of civilians who fled violence. The move towards peaceful relations between Ankara and Damascus represents cause for alarm for the more than 4 million Syrian refugees who have sought shelter in Turkey since 2011. Turkey has recently accelerated efforts to increase what the state calls “voluntary returns”, including official claims that 100,000 people have been repatriated this year to countries including Syria, part of an anti-immigration push ahead of an election expected in June next year or before. Human Rights Watch, however, documented how Turkish authorities arrested hundreds in their homes, workplaces or on the street, before detaining them and forcing them to sign voluntary return forms and then forcing them to cross back into Syria at gunpoint. In 2017, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told a press conference that “[Bashar al-Assad] is definitely a terrorist who has carried out state terrorism”, pointing to the thousands of civilians killed as well as 5.6 million refugees who have fled."

The court said on Monday there were “several hindrances” to sending back Bülent Keneş, a former editor-in-chief of the Zaman daily, who Turkey accuses of being involved in a 2016 attempt to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Kenes is the only person Erdoğan has identified by name among dozens of people Ankara wants extradited in exchange for approving Sweden’s Nato membership. Apart from Hungary, which is due to ratify the countries’ membership in early 2023, Turkey is the only country threatening to prevent them from joining. Turkey, which has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven for outlawed Kurdish groups it deems “terrorists”, has held back on ratifying the Nato applications despite reaching an agreement with the two countries in June. Ankara says it expects Stockholm in particular to take tougher action on several issues, including the extradition of criminals. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, travelled to Turkey in November to meet Erdoğan to discuss the issues. In early December, Sweden extradited to Turkey a convicted member of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), who had fled to Sweden in 2015 but had his asylum request denied. Kenes, who now works for the Stockholm Center for Freedom – an association founded by other Turkish dissidents in exile – said on Monday he was “happy” but not surprised by the court’s opinion. Ankara has over time increased the number of people it wants extradited: first 33, then 45, then 73, in unofficial lists published by media close to the Turkish government."

After four years in construction, the new five-storey, 15,000 sq metre Istanbul Modern will open this year, with Cragg’s white sculpture, entitled Runner, in a prime spot at its entrance. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has clamped down on civil rights in Turkey, with new disinformation laws being used in recent days to arrest a journalist. Artist Mürüvvet Türkyılmaz, who pulled her work from the old Istanbul Modern in 2011 over a censorship row, said she was disappointed with Turner prize-winner Cragg, a leading light in sculpture whose work has been viewed by the Princess of Wales and who made his mark after being invited in 1977 to contribute to the Silver Jubilee. She said: “If there is freedom of expression in Turkey, why are so many people still in prison for just expressing on human rights? Cragg told the Observer that he understood Türkyılmaz’s critique but hoped his piece, which shows “the inner life under a rigid surface”, could be a positive addition to Turkey’s cultural scene. I exhibit my work for everyone, not for a specific group but for the entire, in this case, Turkish population. The new Istanbul Modern building in the Karaköy district has been designed by Italy’s Renzo Piano, who worked with British designer Richard Rogers on Paris’s Pompidou centre. Questions about whether international artists should cooperate with Turkish museums have intensified recently. In October, Turkey’s parliament ratified a law under which those accused of spreading disinformation can be jailed for up to three years. A Turkish court also sentenced Istanbul’s mayor to more than two years in prison and banned him from politics for calling members of Turkey’s supreme election council “fools” in a press release three years ago. The old Istanbul Modern was opened in 2004 with funding from industrial group Eczacıbaşı, but it became embroiled in a censorship row in 2011."

So last week’s court verdict sentencing Istanbul’s popular opposition mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, to more than two years in jail and banning him from public life followed a familiar pattern. Little of importance happens in Erdoğan’s Turkey without his direction or consent. In 2019, he triumphed in Istanbul’s re-run mayoral contest after Erdoğan’s ruling AKP party refused, Trump-like, to accept his initial victory. Thousands of supporters took to Istanbul’s streets, vowing to end the Erdoğan era. Some favour Ankara’s mayor, Mansur Yavaş. Bypassing sanctions imposed by its Nato and European allies, Turkey’s trade with Moscow has jumped by 198% since the Ukraine invasion. EU relations are bedevilled by Turkey’s democratic deficit, refugee disputes and Ankara’s aggressive attitude to Cyprus and Greece. While many would welcome Erdoğan’s fall, the Turks have the most to gain.

İmamoğlu’s victory in 2019 gave the CHP control of Turkey’s largest city, which makes up 40% of the country’s GDP, in a symbolic blow to Erdoğan, who formerly held the same position before he was removed for office and jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred."

Turkish airstrikes followed on Sunday, targeting Kurdish positions in Syria’s north-east, before bellicose warnings by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of another ground push into Kurdish centres that his government has earmarked as new homes for up to 1 million Arab refugees who NGOs fear face imminent exile. Hours after his comments, Kurdish militants fired rockets across the border, killing at least two people and wounding 10 others in a Turkish border town. The few remaining Russian jets in Syria took to the skies later on Sunday and early on Monday morning, bombing rural areas of Idlib near the Turkish border and civilian sites near two refugee camps. The Turkish ones are different. In north-east Syria, Turkish airstrikes have been widespread. Ankara has linked the attacks to revenge for a bombing in Istanbul that killed six people last week and blamed on the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a militant group. The airstrikes are being seen inside the Syrian province as a precursor to a ground invasion, which could try to link Turkish-controlled Jrabalus on the border to the town of Tel Abiad. Incursions over the past three years have already consolidated a Turkish foothold in the area, partly fulfilling Ankara’s goal of forcing Kurds away from the border. Turkish officials have long seen the PKK presence in north-east Syria as an incubator for an insurgency it has fought over four decades with Kurdish rebels in Turkey’s south-east who want to form an independent state. Before a mooted ground operation, some Syrians in Turkey have been returned to border zones. Many more report a growing climate of fear inside Turkey as anti-Syrian rhetoric grows. “We are mopping it up now,” said a regional Turkish official in the south of the country."

The ministry cited Turkey’s right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN charter in launching an operation it called Claw-Sword late on Saturday. The airstrikes came after a bomb rocked a bustling avenue in the heart of Istanbul on 13 November, killing six people and wounding more than 80 others. Turkish authorities blamed the attack on the PKK and its Syrian affiliate the YPG. Ankara and Washington both consider the PKK a terror group, but disagree on the status of the YPG. The PKK has fought an armed insurgency in Turkey since 1984. After the strikes, the defence ministry posted a photo of an F-16 fighter plane with the phrase: “Payback time! The scoundrels are being held to account for their treacherous attacks.” The DHA news agency reported that F-16s took off from airfields in Malatya and Diyarbakır in southern Turkey while drones were launched from Batman. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, oversaw the airstrikes from an operations centre and congratulated the pilots and ground staff. Other Turkish officials responded to the attacks. The presidential spokesperson, İbrahim Kalın, tweeted a photograph of the Turkish flag with the comment “Payback time for Istiklal” a reference to the street where last week’s bombing happened. The airstrikes targeted Kobane, a strategic Kurdish-majority Syrian town near the Turkish border that Ankara had previously attempted to take in its plans to establish a “safe zone” along northern Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces spokesperson, Farhad Shami, wrote in a tweet that two villages heavily populated with displaced people were under Turkish bombardment. In the Syrian town of Derik, which lies where the borders of Syria, Iraq and Turkey meet, the Associated Press found a burnt-out petrol station with destroyed buildings nearby. “There were Turkish airstrikes here, approximately five strikes,” said Abdulgafar Ali, an employee at the petrol station."

The attacks come days after Ankara blamed the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) for last Sunday’s deadly bombing in central Istanbul. “Kobane, the city that defeated Isis, is subjected to bombardment by the aircraft of the Turkish occupation,” tweeted Farhad Shami, a spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Turkey considers the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) – the main component of the SDF – an extension of the outlawed PKK. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the Turkish military had carried out more than 20 airstrikes across the two provinces. Kobane, a Kurdish-majority town in northern Syria near the Turkish border, was captured by the Islamic State group in late 2014, though Kurdish fighters drove them out early the following year. Both the PKK and the YPG have denied any involvement in the Istanbul attack, in which six people were killed. But the Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, has said Ankara believes the order for the attack was given from Kobane."

Turkey’s justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said that “a woman sat on a bench there for 45 minutes”, and that the explosion occurred moments after she left. The Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said early on Monday the attack was planned in a Kurdish-majority city in northern Syria, blaming militants from the PKK and the People’s Defence Units (YPG). “We have nothing to do with this incident and it is well known by the public that we would not target civilians directly or approve of actions directed at civilians,” they said, in a statement attributed to the headquarters command of the People’s Defence Centre (HSM), the armed wing of the group, which is banned in Turkey, the US and the EU. Hours earlier, Turkish officials named a Syrian national, Ahlam Albashir, as the primary suspect in the attack. The Istanbul police department said 46 people had been arrested in a series of early-morning raids and taken into custody. Albashir, they said, “declared that she was trained by the PYD [Democratic Union party]/YPG terrorist organisation as a special intelligence officer”, naming a group with ties to the PKK based in northern Syria, adding that she had entered Turkey through Afrin, a city near Aleppo that has been under Turkish control since 2018. The statements by the PKK and YPG contradicted a barrage of statements from the hardline Soylu, who visited the site in the hours immediately after the deadly blast and claimed that direction for the attack came from Kurdish separatist groups in northern Syria, and specifically the town of Kobanî, also known as Ayn al-Arab, a Kurdish-majority city next to the Syrian border with Turkey. Soylu also used his speech to hit out at the US, whose support for the PYD in northern Syria has been a long-term complaint for Ankara."

While Kurdish militants and attackers linked to Islamic State (IS) have been blamed for attacks on central Istanbul in the past, the attack has not been officially claimed by any group so far. Ankara, Washington and the EU label the PKK a terrorist group, stemming from its decades-long insurgency demanding Kurdish self-rule in south-eastern Turkey. Istanbul police said that 46 people had been detained in total. The Turkish presidential communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, alluded to the potential impact on US-Turkey relations, stemming from Ankara’s long-term displeasure with the US backing of Kurdish groups in northern Syria. Soylu added that Turkey “will not accept messages of condolence” from the US concerning the attack. The PKK is also regularly targeted by Turkish military operations in northern Iraq, while Ankara has also blocked Swedish entry into Nato after accusing it of leniency towards the group. Turkey’s media ombudsman, RTÜK, placed a temporary ban on reporting of the explosion, preventing broadcasters from showing the moment the blast struck or the immediate aftermath, “to avoid broadcasts that may create fear, panic and turmoil in society and may serve the purposes of terrorist organisations”.

The explosion occurred at about 4.20pm local time (13.20 GMT) on Sunday, the Istanbul governor, Ali Yerlikaya, tweeted.

The Turkish parliament recently passed a sweeping new law prohibiting “disinformation”, under which social media users or journalists accused of breaking it could be jailed for up to three years. The Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, of the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP), visited İstiklal Avenue following the explosion, which occurred less than 200 metres from the party’s Istanbul headquarters. Turkey was hit by a string of deadly bombings between 2015 and 2017 by Islamic State and outlawed Kurdish groups. Turkish police later said the bomber had links to IS. In June, attackers armed with automatic weapons and explosives belts attacked the entrance of Istanbul’s Atatürk airport, killing 45 people other than the attackers and injuring more than 230. “Without knowing who is behind this attack, the fact that this is the first terror attack in six years brings back terrible memories of the 2015-16 period when hundreds died across Turkey,” said Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy thinktank."

Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who faces elections next year and is keen to shore up nationalist support, has said his country is still opposed to Sweden’s application, while his ruling AK party spokesperson, Ömer Çelik, said on Monday that Sweden had not yet done enough for Ankara to change its mind. “We are waiting for it to come to life.” Turkey has said it has more objections to Sweden than Finland but both countries last week reiterated they would join Nato at the same time, maintaining a united front. Swedish media have reported that Kristersson is set to attend a bilateral meeting in Ankara, probably on 8 November, a few days after Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who is due to visit the Turkish capital for talks on Friday. According to the state-run Anadolu Agency, Erdoğan told the Swedish prime minister in a phone call last week that “preventing terrorist organisations from taking hostage Sweden’s Nato membership, and its relations with Turkey, is a common interest”. Turkey objected to the applications even before they were submitted, citing the countries’ history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups such as the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) and the followers of the US-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gülen, as well as a 2019 suspension of arms sales."

In a statement, Greek police said the men had testified they had been brought to the area in three Turkish military vehicles before being ordered to remove their clothes before boarding the inflatable boats. “Turkey’s behaviour towards 92 migrants whom we rescued at the borders today is a shame for civilisation,” the politician wrote on the social media site. “We expect Ankara to investigate the incident and protect, at last, its border with the EU.” On Monday, Mitarachi said Turkey had embarked on a campaign of deliberately funnelling immigrants across the EU border as migration becomes an ever more sensitive issue for President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the run-up to elections next year. “Turkey is in a very difficult position because these 92 people were found by Frontex itself which confirmed the incident,” he told SKAI TV, adding he would hand over photographs and other materials, including videos, when he met the head of the UN general assembly, Csaba Kőrösi, next week. “These people were the object of humiliating treatment in Turkey and were sent toward Greece.” Sabre-rattling by Erdoğan and other senior Turkish officials have spurred fears in Athens of military confrontation, with western diplomats voicing concerns of a potential accident, either in the skies or seas of the increasingly militarised Aegean, prompting armed conflict. With the hostility showing no signs of abating, Greek government officials say migrants have become ever more weaponised by Turkey, itself host to about 3.8 million Syrian refugees, amid growing consternation in a nation where the economy has nosedived in recent months. “From what it seems, Turkey does not want to investigate [the incident] because it knows [what really happened],” Mitarachi said in Monday’s TV interview. Ankara has accused Athens of forcibly evicting migrants across the border before they can lodge asylum claims – pushbacks, it claims, that have grown exponentially over the past year. Greece has accused Turkey of deliberately “pushing forward” migrants in an open effort to destabilise the EU despite having agreed in a landmark 2016 accord to contain migrant flows in exchange for billions of euro in aid."

Greek police rescued the men who were discovered naked, some with injuries, close to the northern border with Turkey, police said on Saturday. The migrants were first discovered close to the Evros river that marks the border between Greece and Turkey on Friday, Greek police said in a statement. An investigation by Greek police and officials from Frontex, the European Union’s border agency, found evidence that the migrants crossed the river into Greek territory in rubber dinghies from Turkey, police said. The migrants reportedly told police and officers of Frontex that they had been forced by Turkish authorities to board three vehicles that took them to the border. “Turkey’s provocative behaviour exceeded all limits,” Greece’s ministry of asylum and migration said on Saturday. Commenting, in Greek and English he tweeted: “Turkey’s behaviour towards 92 migrants whom we rescued at the borders today is a shame for civilisation. We expect Ankara to investigate the incident and protect at last, its borders with the EU.” Fahrettin Altun, the head of Turkey’s communications directorate and president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s chief spokesperson, described the allegations as “groundless and unfounded” in a series of tweets posted late on Sunday. The United Nations also responded by issuing a statement on Sunday, saying it was “deeply distressed” by the discovery of almost 100 naked men at the border between Greece and Turkey. Greece was on the frontline of a European migration crisis in 2015 and 2016, when around a million refugees fleeing war and poverty in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan arrived in the country, mainly via Turkey. The number of arrivals has fallen since then, but Greek authorities said they had recently seen an increase in attempted arrivals through the Turkish land border and the Greek islands.

The Turkish president’s initial suggestion that deadly mining disasters are a natural consequence of a risky industry echoed his controversial response to Turkey’s worst ever mining disaster, which killed 301 people in the town of Soma in 2014, where he said that “these things happen”, leading to furious reactions and protests. Police in Ankara stopped his car and questioned him, he said, and told him that the Bartin governor’s office would not allow him and other lawyers to enter the area and that “we should turn back”. This is downright murder,” said Emin Koramaz, the head of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects."

Turkish officials including the energy minister, Fatih Dönmez, said initial assessments indicated the blast on Friday inside the state-owned mine was caused by a firedamp explosion, a reference to the combustion of pockets of highly flammable gases trapped in the coal bed. The head of one Turkish mining union told the local Cumhuriyet news outlet that increasing safety measures after disasters was insufficient. “The important thing is to value people while they are alive,” he said, referencing two major mining disasters in Turkey in 2014. “There are mines all over the world, but these disasters always occur in mines in Turkey,” he said. A prolonged fire inside a mine in the town of Soma in western Turkey in 2014 caused the worst mining disaster in the country’s history, where 301 miners died from carbon monoxide poisoning and at least 162 others were injured. The Turkish Hard Coal Authority stated that İbrahim Özkarcı, who heads the energy division of a government audit body, recently visited the mining facility in Amasra, but pushed back against reports that he had done so “for audit purposes”. Shortly before the incident, Turkey’s parliament passed a sweeping new law criminalising alleged disinformation, which campaigners warned muzzled vital press freedoms in the run-up to an election expected in June 2023 or before. Turkey’s police headquarters said they would take legal against 12 people who they claimed incited hate about the incident on social media."

A coalition of 22 press freedom organisations said the bill “provides a framework for extensive censorship of online information and the criminalisation of journalism, which will enable the government to further subdue and control public debate in the lead up to Turkey’s general elections in 2023”. The new law means those found guilty of intentionally publishing disinformation or “fake news” that the authorities claim spreads panic, endangers security forces or the overall health of Turkish society could be sentenced to up to three years in prison. “It criminalises what the authorities call disinformation without defining what that actually means,” said the journalist Emre Kızılkaya, head of the Turkish branch of the Vienna-based International Press Institute, one of the organisations to condemn the bill. Journalists, press freedom watchdogs and even the Council of Europe condemned the bill as it slowly moved through its debate stages in Turkey’s parliament, urging the government to drop it before it became law. Turkey currently ranks 149 out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index for 2022, and campaigners fear these additional restrictions will affect the media’s ability to accurately cover Turkey’s forthcoming election, expected in or before June. Campaigners, including the Turkish Journalists’ Union (TGS), also criticised the government over the choice to consult American social media companies over the bill while failing “to seek the views of the journalism organisations in Turkey who will be directly affected”. Turkish authorities previously clashed with Meta, Facebook’s owner, over a demand that every social media company with more than 1 million users appoint a local representative required to answer to the government, and to store users’ data locally. “This will also force digital platforms like Google News or Facebook to reveal their algorithms to the government, showing the Turkish state what content they boost and what they suppress,” said Kızılkaya."

The boats that are being sent from Turkey are moving bombs … They are small sailboats that shouldn’t have more than 15 or 20 persons onboard, and they have 100.” Although Kythira is about 250 miles west of Turkey, it is part of a southern route increasingly used by smugglers intent on bypassing Greece, where patrols have been reinforced, and heading directly to Italy. After the incidents, the Greek migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, issued an “urgent call” to Turkey to “take immediate action to prevent all irregular departures due to harsh weather conditions”. Athens has accused Ankara of flouting a landmark agreement reached with the EU in March 2016 to stem flows of refugees and migrants by deliberately pushing people across Greek land and sea borders as part of a broader “weaponisation” policy. On Wednesday, Mitarachi countered that Turkey was “violently pushing forward migrants to Greece, in violation of international law”. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told the United Nations general assembly last month that Greece’s “oppressive policies” towards refugees and migrants were turning the Aegean into a “graveyard”."

The biggest barrier for Afghans claiming asylum is the Greek government’s controversial decision to label Turkey a “safe third country” for people not only from Afghanistan but also from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria. They keep saying we should return to Turkey, even if Turkey doesn’t take anyone back from Greece.” Amid renewed tensions with Turkey, the public order minister in Athens claimed last month that every night about 1,500 people gathered at the land border with Turkey were attempting to cross as a result of Ankara’s policy to “weaponise” migration and push asylum seekers into Greek territory. After the adoption of a controversial pact aimed at stemming flows between the EU and Turkey in March 2016, the influx dropped steeply. As patrols have been reinforced, with the help of the EU’s border agency Frontex, the number has fallen further in recent years, particularly arrivals on the north Aegean islands facing the Turkish coast, where most asylum seekers at the height of the crisis were located. Last week, Mitarachi insisted the government would continue to replace open-air camps on frontline islands, such as Lesbos, with barbed-wire encircled “closed controlled” access centres, and would push ahead with plans to extend a border fence along the Evros land frontier with Turkey."

There are more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, where there have been recent reports of rising tensions and violence against Syrians in parts of the country. As dawn broke on Monday, members of the caravan began their journey to the designated meeting point of Edirne, a city in the north-west of Turkey near the border with Greece, which was announced on the Telegram channel the day before. In a statement, the organisers explained that the caravan, which “came out of the womb of the revolution”, was sparked by the “abhorrent racism” they have been exposed to from “some parties in the Turkish republic”, which they say has led to Syrians being killed. As of Tuesday morning, the caravan had decided to regroup in Istanbul before heading to the border together in one group. Khairu, a 22-year-old engineer, came to Turkey in 2018 from Homs, and is planning to join the caravan. He left his home in Mersin, a city in the south, on Monday to go to Istanbul where he is meeting friends travelling from Hayat, near the Syrian-Turkish border. He said he had experienced racism while living in Turkey, and wanted to “live without the fear of tomorrow, because fear of tomorrow is a very slow death”. Yuko Narushima, a spokesperson for the the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) told the Guardian the agency was aware of social media announcements aimed at organising large movements of people from Turkey towards the EU, but it was not involved and did not encourage this. Already, about 400 people have been forced to return to their homes in Idlib, Syria, after they tried to cross the Syrian border into Turkey to join the caravan but were attacked by hardline Islamist militants. Taha Elghazi, a prominent Syrian refugee rights activist in Turkey, who is not part of the caravan, said he understood why many Syrians want to leave Turkey because of the “rise in racism”, as well as financial difficulties caused by “economic inflation”. However, he warned that the Turkish government would not allow groups to gather at the border with Greece, while EU countries were also tightening security on their borders."

In a new report, HRW accuses the Turkish government of exacerbating the health and environmental impact on the workers by failing to enforce laws that require strict licensing and regular inspections of recycling centres. The EU, the biggest plastic waste exporter to Turkey between 2017 and 2021, and the UK, the largest single plastic exporter during the same period, were also contributing “significantly” to health and environmental rights abuses in Turkey, the report said. After China banned plastic waste imports in 2018, the EU’s plastic waste exports to Turkey skyrocketed by 1,200% from 38,804 tonnes to 446,432 tonnes in 2021. Krista Shennum, Gruber fellow at HRW and the report’s lead researcher, said: “The government of Turkey is failing to implement its laws. “Europe’s wealthiest countries are sending their trash to Turkey, consigning some of Turkey’s most vulnerable communities, including children, refugees and migrants, to serious environmental and health risks,” she said. “We call on the UK, the EU and other countries to manage their own waste domestically rather than exporting it to Turkey, where it is causing human health and human rights harms.” Turkey should reinstate the ban on plastic waste imports it imposed in July 2021 but then quickly lifted, she added. In Turkey, it is illegal for anyone under 18 to work in hazardous waste facilities, including in plastic recycling facilities. Yet HRW, which interviewed 64 people in the southern Turkish city of Adana and Istanbul, including 26 who now work or have previously worked in plastic recycling facilities, found a third had either begun the work as children or were children when interviewed. Researchers found that workers in Turkish recycling plants included refugees and undocumented migrants. Many facilities were “dangerously close” to homes, schools or hospitals, in contravention of Turkish laws and environmental regulations, the report found. The Turkish ministry of labour and social security told HRW it had undertaken 105 inspections of plastic waste recycling centres between 2017 and 2021, with 26 found to be breaking the law."

Or Elif Shafak’s novels, which highlight the difficulty of being a woman in Turkey? Does our literature have to be political in order to be considered “Turkish”? In my latest novel, At the Breakfast Table, a family gathering to celebrate the matriarch’s 100th birthday soon exposes the family’s – and Turkey’s – fraught history. In this way, I see my writing as Turkish – these are the issues that we breathe every day; they are buried in the soil under our feet. Yet there is also a balance: the greatest Turkish literature discusses serious issues, but will also lighten the heart and put a smile on your face. With the choices below, I wanted to highlight books about Turkey that not only talk about its historical and social context, but also reflect the distinctive styles and the creativity of their authors in dealing with individual, philosophical and political questions. In the Shadow of the Yali by Suat DervisOriginally published in 1945, this is the Madame Bovary of Turkish literature. One of Turkey’s leading female authors, Dervis (1905–72) wrote about the loss and longing of urban, affluent Turkish women. In this novel, Celile is torn between her respectable husband and her passionate tango partner in 1940s Istanbul. Although the story is, in many ways, universal, Dervis brilliantly captures the particularities of Turkish society and its struggle with modernity. Set in 1970s Istanbul, it follows 30-year-old Kemal, the son of an educated urban family, who falls in love with a distant relative – the beautiful 18-year-old Füsun – who comes from a family of modest means. Pamuk has also built a real Museum of Innocence: if you are visiting Istanbul, you can go to Füsun’s house and see “her” shoes and dresses, cinema tickets, and the hundreds of cigarette butts that the heartbroken Kemal collected. It is at once funny and tragic, a modern Istanbul story that takes place in 10 flats which sit within the once-glorious, now dilapidated Bonbon Palace. A story within a story which is told from the different perspectives of the building’s residents, The Flea Palace paints a brilliant picture of Turkey on the brink of the 21st century, and is written with intelligence and love."

At first, unable to sit in cafes, or stroll about his beloved city of Istanbul alone, he worried that having protection would distance him from the everyday life that is his inspiration. But over the years he has become “quite relaxed about it … I’m used to it.” As he likes to joke: “I used to have three bodyguards, now I have one, which means Turkey is improving.” Unlike Rushdie, the greatest threat to him is not necessarily from Muslim fundamentalists but Turkish nationalists. (Although as he points out: “These two groups are not too distant from each other, as Turkey is currently governed by an Islamic-nationalist coalition.”) He has already been investigated – twice – following the publication of his new novel in Turkey in March last year, for accusations of inciting “hatred and animosity” by insulting the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and ridiculing the Turkish flag. He is talking not from Istanbul, the city where he has lived most of his life (he’s now 70), much of it in the same building, and which he has made his own in books including his bestseller My Name Is Red in 1998, and his memoir, Istanbul: Memories and the City in 2005. “Even if I write a novel that doesn’t take place in Istanbul, someone in it has a wish to go back to Istanbul,” he jokes. Today he is staying in his rented villa on the island of Büyükada, one and a half hours from Istanbul in the Sea of Marmara, where he has spent most of his summers since he was a child. Pamuk’s fictional Mingheria is also based on the tiny Greek island of Kastellorizo (Meis to the Turks), where he often goes in May when it is still chilly in Istanbul, to “write, write, write, swim, swim, swim, and look at the island”, and the much bigger Crete."

However, authorities in Ankara, scarred by the mass arrival of refugees from Syria, were determined to keep them out, erecting a barrier on the border with Iran even before the fall of Kabul. After a 24-hour journey packed into a small bus, Shukriya and her husband arrived in a small town near the Iran-Turkey border where they spent a week waiting before they were led towards the wall. On the other side of the border, in the Turkish city of Van, they were rounded up and arrested, put in camps and threatened with deportation. The Turkish officials took pity on them and issued them with temporary papers. Instead, they found themselves trapped in Turkey, unable to settle and work without permits yet not allowed to move anywhere else. In Istanbul, which is home to a large Afghan community, the couple now live in a small, stuffy, hot attic flat with a thin metal roof.

The 46-year-old singer-songwriter, whose full name is Gülşen Çolakoğlu, was taken away from her home in Istanbul for questioning and formally arrested late on Thursday. Government critics said the move was an effort by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to consolidate support from his religious and conservative base ahead of elections in 10 months’ time. The charges were based on a joke Gülşen made during an April concert in Istanbul, where she quipped that one of her musicians’ “perversion” stemmed from attending a religious school. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of Turkey’s main opposition party, called on judges and prosecutors to release Gülşen. The spokesperson for Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party, known by its Turkish abbreviation AKP, appeared, however, to defend the decision to arrest the singer, saying “inciting hatred is not an art form”. “Targeting a segment of society with the allegation of “perversion” and trying to polarise Turkey is a hate crime and a disgrace to humanity,” the AKP spokesperson Ömer Çelik tweeted.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, over the weekend added his voice to a growing chorus of officials who had markedly shifted rhetoric on Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, claiming: “Political dialogue or diplomacy cannot be cut off between states.” He was followed on Tuesday by Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who said Ankara would not set “conditions for dialogue” with Syria, being guided instead by achieving its goals. The remarks were the clearest signal yet that Turkey has embarked on a new policy that intends to stabilise Assad, after being a chief regional proponent of his ousting for more than a decade. The two states and Turkey now have a prominent stake in a fractured post-war country where large parts of the population remain outside the control of the central government. Erdoğan has previously staunchly opposed Russian bombings in Idlib, where Turkey has established significant influence, but the new attacks met no reaction from Ankara, which has drawn closer to Vladimir Putin’s view of a solution for Syria in recent months. The Turkish leader is understood to have been dissuaded from launching a new incursion into the Kurdish north-east of Syria last month after speaking to Putin during a summit in Sochi. Kurdish groups in the north-east, backed by the Kurdistan workers’ party (PKK), have been bracing for a fresh Turkish incursion, which they fear aims to carve out a new sphere of influence along the border with Turkey, into which Ankara will transfer Arab refugees who have been hosted in Turkey over the past decade. Turkey has already announced plans to send up to 1 million refugees back to Syria, and has funded the construction of homes in areas between Kurds in the north-west and north-east, effectively creating a wedge between them. “The messaging from the Turks is very clear. A senior Kurdish official in north-eastern Syria on Monday described Turkey’s rapprochement with Assad as a “trick” “Turkey has never supported the Syrian revolution,” said Ilham Ahmad, a member of the region’s executive council."

Like most UN members, Turkey does not recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and its embassy is located in Tel Aviv. Çavuşoğlu said a Turkish ambassador would be designated after a list was presented to the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Turkey’s relations with Israel disintegrated when 10 civilians were killed after an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship, part of a flotilla aimed at breaching a blockade of Gaza in 2010. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, paid a landmark visit to Ankara in March and held talks with Erdoğan, who said the meeting marked “a turning point in our relations”.

Lawyers acting on their behalf obtained an interim measure from the European court of human rights on 20 July to allow them to remain, yet days later they were forcibly pushed back to Turkey and taken into custody. Civil society groups have put pressure on Turkey and Greece to rescue the group. Ankara made no comment but Athens claimed it was unable to help as the islet, charted as Greek on maps, was in Turkey. The NGO Uluslararası Mülteci Hakları Derneği – which has ties to the Turkish government – said in a statement that security officers from the nearby city of Edirne came within 75 metres of the coordinates supplied by the migrants on 10 August and used a megaphone, but received no response. In recent months thousands have attempted to cross the Evros, dividing Turkey and Greece, taking advantage of shallow summer waters. It is feared that an increasing number of Syrians could attempt the dangerous journey to Europe as Turkey starts to implement plans, announced in May, to return a million migrants to areas of Syria under Turkish military control. Turkey is home to the world’s largest refugee population, with 3.6 million Syrians registered there alone, and the strain of this has led to anti-immigrant sentiment."

Another three ships carrying almost 60,000 tonnes of grain between them departed Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Friday and are on their way to Britain, Ireland and Turkey respectively. A Ukrainian government report described by the Washington Post said Putin would seek Russian stakes in Turkish oil refineries, terminals and reservoirs in order to help disguise the origin of Russian oil exports ahead of a planned EU oil embargo. The Russian government did not confirm the report and there was no indication that Turkey would entertain the proposals, which would put the Nato member at considerable risk of secondary sanctions. Putin noted that the TurkStream pipeline had continued operating “smoothly … in contrast to every other route supplying our hydrocarbons”. Turkey is a member of Nato, has sold advanced weaponry such as Bayraktar drones to Ukraine, and is at odds with Russia over the future of Syria, where the Kremlin has backed Bashar al-Assad while Turkey has sought to gain influence in the country’s north."

In recent months there have been frequent clashes in the area, a mountainous pocket of Iraq close to the Turkish border in which Turkish troops maintain bases. The presence of the Turkish army on Iraqi soil has long been a point of friction between Baghdad and Ankara, but the Kurdistan regional government of Iraq has facilitated the Turkish presence to help combat the PKK, which it accuses of subverting its authority. Protesters rallied outside Turkish government buildings in both cities, angrily demanding accountability from Ankara. Authorities in Erbil were examining whether Turkish gunners had fired at the tourist group after mistaking them for guerrillas, whether PKK members had been in the area, or whether the militia group itself had been responsible. “At the beginning when we arrived there we heard bombing from afar but we asked a Kurdish guy there [and] he said not to worry as there is a Turkish military base nearby doing training."

Erdoğan cited Kurdish forces in Tel Rifaat and Manbij, two towns in north-west Syria where Russian and Iranian forces are present, as justification for Turkey extending its zone of control in the country. “What we expect from Iran and Russia is to support Turkey in its fight against terrorist organisations,” he told a press conference following the meeting. Putin and Erdoğan greeted each other warmly at the start of their bilateral talks, despite a brief moment where the Turkish leader kept his counterpart waiting. The talks provided an opportunity for Erdoğan to secure Moscow’s backing for a tentative agreement to evacuate grain across the Black Sea with a control centre in Istanbul, with UN-backed talks expected to continue in Istanbul this week. The Turkish president later referred to his counterpart as “my dear friend Putin” during a roundtable discussion on Syria. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, Turkish authorities have insisted on balancing the country’s Nato membership with its longstanding relationship with Moscow. Turkey has hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and sold Ukraine armed drones for use against Russian forces. But Turkey has declined to join sanctions against Russia, stepped up its purchases of Russian oil since the invasion, and continues to push ahead with construction of a nuclear power plant by the Russian state company Rosatom, under threat due to western sanctions on Sberbank, a major backer of the project. “Russia can’t afford not to engage with Turkey. They want a relationship with Turkey as a Nato ally – that wouldn’t change even if Putin and Erdoğan step aside tomorrow,” said Hanna Notte, an analyst at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. Yet Erdoğan’s approach to foreign policy rests on showing that Turkey acts independently, putting its interests first. Despite previously lifting objections to Finland and Sweden joining Nato and securing the lifting of some weapons sales in the process, Erdoğan this week repeated threats to “freeze” their accession if Turkish demands aren’t met."

Turkey, a Nato member, has a special responsibility under the 1936 Montreux convention for naval traffic entering the Black Sea. Though Putin praised the Turkish leader for mediating talks, saying some progress had been made, he was less impressed with Erdoğan’s ambitions to construct a buffer zone south of the Turkish-Syrian border.

The White House said the Tehran summit held between Putin, the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, showed how isolated the Russian leader had become – which was not an observation shared by Moscow, who claimed it showed Russia remained respected in the Middle East. In a day of intense diplomacy involving bilateral talks followed by a trilateral summit about Syria, Putin praised the Turkish leader for mediating talks on the export of grain from Ukraine, saying there had been some progress. Since the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey, a Nato member, has responsibility for naval traffic entering the Black Sea. The Turkish president, potentially exploiting Putin’s distractions in Ukraine, has been preparing a fresh military incursion into northern Syria in a bid to construct a buffer zone 30km south of the Turkish-Syrian border. He claims the buffer zone would shield Turkey from attacks by Syrian Kurds led by the US-backed YPG militia, as well as provide space for the voluntary return of as many as 1 million Syrian refugees from inside Turkey. But Khamenei expressed his broad objections to a fresh Turkish incursion, saying this would definitely be to the detriment of Syria, Turkey and the region. Erdoğan, speaking at the start of the trilateral meeting, appeared to assert his unilateral right to mount an invasion, saying it was “not possible to expect Turkey to sit idle and aloof from this problem”. Turkey regards the YPG as indistinguishable from the Turkish Kurdish terrorist groups."

Although there was broad agreement about Ukraine, tensions were on display when Khamenei warned Turkey against an incursion into northern Syria. Erdoğan, possibly taking advantage of Putin’s distractions in Ukraine, has been threatening a new military offensive in northern Syria to drive away US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters from Turkey’s borders. The operation is part of Turkey’s plan to create a safe zone along its border with Syria that would encourage the voluntary return of Syrian refugees, a move that would be popular inside Turkey as Erdoğan prepares for difficult elections next year. “Any sort of military attack in northern Syria will definitely harm Turkey, Syria and the entire region, and will benefit terrorists,” Iran’s leader said, stressing the need to “bring the issue to an end through talks”. In recent weeks Syrian Kurds have asked Iran and Russia to defend them against Turkish threats.

Russia, too, is anxious to avoid another Turkish push – after a brief incursion in October 2019 – into an area in which it has developed a foothold. Idlib’s residents have been at the mercy of global powers for much of the past decade, but increasingly so lately as Russia attempts to diminish Turkish influence in the province and restore Assad’s tutelage to a crucial corner of the country that remains outside his control.

In the case of Turkey, the committee went further by accusing its leaders of being complicit in the massacres, alleging it failed to police its borders to halt the free flow of IS fighters, including a significant number of Turkish nationals. Turkish officials have said the criticisms are baseless. The committee claimed that from April 2014, Turkish officials turned a blind eye to the sale, transfer and enslavement of Yazidi women and children, and helped train fighters affiliated with IS to fight its Kurdish enemies in Syria, so strengthening the perpetrators of the genocide. “Turkish officials knew and/or were wilfully blind to evidence that these individuals would use this training to commit prohibited acts against the Yazidis,” the report said. The Turkish ambassador to the UK, Ümit Yalçın, said the criticisms were baseless and unfair. He said Turkey “starting from the early years of the conflict in Syria played a key role in the protection of Syrian civilians and minorities, including Yazidis, in the region against the attacks and violations of terrorist groups. “Turkey not only opened its doors and became a safe heaven for millions of Syrians and Yazidis but also provided protection for the people of the region through three counter terrorism operations in Syria. “Moreover, last year many Yazidi families that took refugee in north-western Syria tried to return to their homes in Syria’s north-east but [were] prevented from doing so by PKK/YPG [the initials of the Kurdish groups in Turkey and Syria].”"

Abortion is legal on request in Turkey to all women up to the 10th week of pregnancy, and up to the 20th week for medical reasons. Yet Esra visited one hospital after another in Istanbul, trying to arrange a termination, and was turned away from them all. In Turkey, women’s right to access free and safe medical abortions is increasingly under threat. A study by Kadir Has university found that by 2020, there was not a single public hospital performing on-demand abortions in Istanbul. According to the survey, only eight of Turkey’s 81 provinces have at least one public hospital performing on-demand abortions, and only two of them have more than one. The Guardian interviewed more than a dozen Turkish women who had all had abortions in the last three years. “There is a de facto ban in many places,” explains Filiz, a nurse at a public hospital in Istanbul where abortions are not performed. “Under Turkish law, a doctor cannot tell a woman she cannot have an abortion, but refusal is very common, forcing women to go begging from hospital to hospital,” says Filiz, who prefers not to give her surname. This de facto ban appears to be shaped by the increasingly populist and hardline approach to abortion taken by the Turkish government. “We have increasingly seen hospital administrations put pressure on physicians to not practise abortions,” says Irmak Saraç, an obstetrician and member of the women’s commission at the Istanbul Medical Chamber. A year ago, she became pregnant and travelled to Istanbul to have an abortion. Ilknur was five weeks’ pregnant, and with the help of two friends called more than 20 public hospitals in Istanbul. “I even talked to hospitals in other cities near Istanbul but found nothing.” Across Turkey, some healthcare workers – including Filiz – are now attempting to help women access their right to a safe abortion, drawing up lists of medical staff still willing to carry out free abortions."

The growth in annual prices rose from 73.5% in May to 78.6% in June, according to the Turkish statistics agency. Erdoğan has claimed that Turkey’s problem is not inflation. Economists said Turkey’s official data disguised a more disturbing trend of rising prices that had shown no sign of abating. A monthly report release by Turkey’s ENAG group of independent economists showed consumer prices had risen by 175% in June compared with a year earlier. The Istanbul chamber of commerce said inflation in Turkey‘s largest city had reached an annual rate of 94%. “No one actually believes official Turkish data any more,” said Timothy Ash, an economist at BlueBay Asset Management. The growing dispute over the veracity of Turkey’s official data is expected to be a difficult political issue for Erdoğan’s government ahead of next year’s general election, which is widely viewed as the toughest of his two-decade rule. Turkey was hit hard by the fallout from the European debt crisis in 2012 and the threat of higher interest rates by the US Federal Reserve in 2013. The Turkish lira has plummeted 20% this year alone."

With its western shores that straddle the Aegean, Turkey says the time has come to stop associating the region exclusively with Greece. Last December, it lodged a request with the EU’s intellectual property office to trademark the term TurkAegean. As Turkish claims mount in the region, Greece’s top EU official, the European Commission vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, demanded the decision be reviewed. In a tersely worded letter to Thierry Breton, his counterpart in charge of internal markets, Schinas chided the EU body for failing to properly publicise Ankara’s request to use the term in the tourism campaign. The TurkAegean slogan, predominant in the advertising of what Turkey has also labelled its “coastline of happiness”, has in recent days been rolled out with a vengeance, further riling Greeks. “The Turkish Aegean is one of the most exquisite regions Türkiye has to offer,” the nation’s culture and tourism minister, Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, told the Financial Times, referring to an area with ruins that include ancient Troy and the port city of Ephesus, once viewed by Greeks as the most important trading centre in the Mediterranean. Advocates of rapprochement point out what TurkAegean makes evident: that from spectacular coastline to music and food, the two countries have more in common than they might like to believe. By Friday, hopes of detente in the wake of Madrid’s Nato summit had waned dramatically after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, reiterated he would not be meeting Mitsotakis until he “pulls himself together”. In May, Erdoğan announced he would cut off ties with Mitsotakis after the Greek leader called on Washington to not sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey during a speech before the US Congress. Ankara has accused Athens of deliberately militarising islands close to the Turkish coast in contravention of international treaties."

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said at the close of the alliance’s summit in Madrid that the 10-article agreement with the Nordic pair was a victory for Ankara and addressed all its “sensitivities”. He particularly stressed the satisfying of Turkey’s demand for Sweden and Finland to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups or the network of an exiled cleric accused of a failed 2016 coup in Turkey. But Erdoğan added that if the two Nordic countries renege on their promises, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday. Erdoğan claimed that Sweden had promised to extradite 73 “terrorists” to Turkey and crack down on the financing and recruitment activities of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) –– listed as a terrorist group by the US and the EU –– and linked groups. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) an extension of the PKK. It says Finland and Sweden will address Turkey’s “pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly, taking into account information, evidence and intelligence provided” by Turkey in accordance with the European convention on extradition. On Wednesday, the Turkish justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said Sweden and Finland’s justice ministries have files from Turkey on 33 people with alleged links to PKK and the network of US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen. The Swedish government has sought to allay concerns that the deal would lead to extraditions to Turkey without due process."

Speaking at a briefing call on Wednesday, Celeste Wallander, the assistant secretary for defence for international security affairs at the Pentagon, told reporters that strong Turkish defence capabilities would reinforce Nato’s defences. Biden met Erdoğan at the Nato summit in Madrid the day after a last-minute agreement between Turkey, Finland and Sweden was sealed, in which the two Nordic countries vow to take steps to control support for Kurdish terrorism in their countries. Erdoğan had been threatening to block Sweden and Finland from joining Nato indefinitely in a move designed to assert Turkey’s centrality to Nato, and press the rest of the alliance to take the threat of Kurdish terrorism on its southern borders more seriously. Biden rewarded Erdoğan’s lifting of the veto by staging the Madrid meeting and authorising his officials to say they were willing to help in the modernisation of the Turkish air force. Russia notified the UN it was willing to go along with the plans overseen by Turkey in which 25m tonnes of grain would be shipped out of the Ukrainian-held and heavily mined port of Odesa in safe convoys. Discussing the modernisation of the Turkish air force, Wallander said: “The United States supports Turkey’s modernisation of its fighter fleet because that is a contribution to Nato security and therefore American security … These plans are in the works. Turkey made a request to the US in October to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16 fighters and nearly 80 modernisation kits for its existing warplanes. US officials rejected any suggestion Washington was backing the warplane request in order to remove Turkey’s objections to Sweden and Finland’s entry to Nato. The sale of the fighter jets is contentious because Turkey bought a Russian air defence system that many US senators say is incompatible with Nato membership. Turkey also moved to exploit the deal to demand the immediate extradition from Sweden of a named group of Kurds and supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gülen."

Nato said a trilateral deal had been reached at a meeting between Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President Sauli Niinistö of Finland and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in the Spanish capital. “Turkey, Finland and Sweden have signed a memorandum that addresses Turkey’s concerns, including around arms exports and the fight against terrorism,” he added. Andersson said she had shown the Turkish leader changes in Sweden’s terrorism legislation set to come into force next month. “And of course, we will continue our fight against terrorism and as Nato members also do so with closer cooperation with Turkey,” the Swedish premier said. Turkey had said it would block the applications of Sweden and Finland unless it received satisfactory assurances that the Nordic countries were willing to address what it regards as support for Kurdish groups it designates as terrorist organisations, in particular the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). Because Nato operates by consensus, it is possible for one country in the 30-strong military alliance to block an application, giving Ankara leverage when the two countries sought to join earlier this year. Turkey said it was satisfied with the outcome. “Turkey has made significant gains in the fight against terrorist organisations,” said a statement released by Erdoğan’s office on Tuesday, adding: “Turkey got what it wanted.” The text of the memorandum signed by all three leaders says that Finland and Sweden will “extend their full support” to Turkey in matters of national security. Finland and Sweden affirmed in the deal there were no national arms embargoes relating to sales to Turkey and all three countries said they would work together on extradition requests. Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees and Turkey has called for the extradition of individuals it says are linked to the PKK or the Syrian YPG. Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had agreed to a “further amending their domestic legislation” to give Turkey the anti-terror reassurances it had sought, and would be “cracking down on PKK activities” and “entering into an agreement with Turkey on extradition”."

They said they witnessed Greek police strip, rob and assault asylum seekers before they were put back into overcrowded inflatable boats that the men were then ordered to transport back across the deep and fast-running river to the Turkish bank. Reports of pushbacks have multiplied since March 2020 when thousands of people, many herded there by Turkish authorities, arrived at Greek borders after Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced he had opened “the gate” into Europe. Bassel*, a Syrian, said he spent three months in a police cell at Tychero, near the Greece-Turkey border, pushing others back. “This work is very dangerous, also because of the enmity between the Greeks and the Turks,” Bassel said. Police sources speaking to the investigation confirmed that it is to avoid confrontations with Turkish security forces that proxies like Bassel are used. All had paid up to €5,000 (£4,300) to an Istanbul middleman to cross into Greece via a smuggler, who said there would be a Syrian waiting for them with Greek police. They were horrified to realise they were expected to row migrant boats back to Turkey in exchange for their own crossing. Farhad said he initially refused to participate but was told by “Mike” he risked not just losing his money but “vanishing” if he returned to Istanbul. Bassel was released and has now left Greece, but is traumatised by his time kept in a cell and brought out, masked, to row groups of desperate, often half-naked asylum seekers back to Turkey."

Turkey has been trying to negotiate the terms of an escort for more than 20m tonnes of urgently needed Ukrainian grain, but Çavuşoğlu said he had not been able to secure a date for a meeting between Ukraine and Russia – a sign that an agreement on safe passage for the convoy had not been reached. Turkey has been offering to run a control centre in Istanbul from which the convoy operation could be jointly policed. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is also in Turkey to discuss the British contribution to any convoy plan, as well to persuade Turkey to lift its current block on Sweden and Finland joining Nato over what Turkey categorises as a soft line on Turkish Kurdish terrorists operating in their countries. So far there has been no breakthrough, although Turkey is pleased that a special session on threats to Nato on its southern flank will be included at the Nato summit, providing an opportunity for Ankara to raise the issue. Çavuşoğlu said Sweden had provided papers to Turkey on what it was prepared to do to block the financing of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) from Sweden. The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since the 80s and is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU.

He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks. “God willing, we will have the opportunity to assess to what much higher level we can take Turkey-Saudi Arabia relations,” Erdoğan said, announcing the sudden visit late last week. The visit, including a private meeting and a state dinner, is expected to yield significant trade deals from Turkey. Prince Mohammed’s visit to Ankara also represents a major shift in Middle Eastern politics and the latest efforts to welcome Saudi Arabia back into the international community after pledges to isolate the kingdom because of Khashoggi’s murder. Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: “I highly doubt that Turkey’s assessment of what happened to Khashoggi and how it happened has changed. Turkey may have preferred to have more of a behind-the-scenes private de-escalation and normalisation, but the Saudi government very much wanted to make this public display and official recognition part of the normalisation between two countries.” Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee and a Turkish citizen, tweeted: “His visit to our country doesn’t change the fact that he is responsible for a murder. Erdoğan previously spearheaded international efforts to condemn Khashoggi’s murder, calling Turkey “the representative of the world’s common conscience” in a speech in October 2018. The Turkish president also persistently publicised detailed information about the killing, including a gruesome transcript of an audio recording from inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul as it took place. The decision also marked a realignment of regional politics after the decision by a coalition of Gulf nations and Egypt to blockade Turkey’s ally Qatar in 2017."

Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring alleged members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and also objects to their decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to Ankara due to Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Turkey has gone on a public diplomacy offensive to highlight Swedish support for Kurdish groups in northern Syria that it links to the PKK – designated as a terrorist organisation in the EU, US and Turkey – and is planning to stage a fringe meeting on the issue at the Nato summit. “This is a matter of vital national interest, and we are prepared to prevent their membership for as long as a year if necessary,” said Akif Çağatay Kılıç, an MP for the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) and chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee. “Turkey is the second largest army in Nato and has been providing the drones that help Ukraine defend itself.

Sweden imposed restrictions on arms sales in 2019 after Turkey’s invasion of northern Syria. The policy paper said Sweden would “contribute to all of Nato’s security including that of Turkey”. Although Turkish demands can vary, officials have said they want to see specific Kurdish activists deported to Turkey, as well as the sacking of the Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, over a 2011 meeting with the PKK, which has been designated as a terrorist organisation in Sweden since 1984. Ankara would like the two countries to sever ties with the US-backed Syrian Kurdish autonomous administration, which Turkey says has a synonymous leadership to the PKK."

However, the Turkish foreign affairs minister struck a more considered note, saying more talks between Moscow and Kyiv would be required to ensure the safety of any vessels carrying exports. Speaking alongside Lavrov in Ankara, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu described a United Nations plan to launch a sea corridor for Ukrainian grain exports as “reasonable” but added that Russia and Ukraine would have to accept any agreement. “Various ideas have been put out for the export of Ukrainian grains to the market and most recently is the UN plan [including] a mechanism that can be created between the UN, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey,” Çavuşoğlu said. The UN subsequently appealed to Russia and Ukraine, as well as Nato member Turkey – which has authority over maritime traffic entering and leaving the Black Sea through the Bosphorus strait – to agree a corridor. Any Turkish-brokered grain corridor would probably involve cargo vessels leaving Odesa, which is in Ukrainian hands, and other Black Sea ports with a Turkish naval escort, before travelling towards Turkey and on to global markets. Turkey, which has good relations with Kyiv and Moscow, made a show early in the war of trying to act as a mediator between the two sides but ceasefire talks have since faded.

Maybe so, although in typically high-handed fashion, Erdoğan does not appear to have asked the Turkish people for their views. Nor has he consulted Welsh and French speakers, for example, who have their own ways of talking turkey. Land areas occupied by present-day Turks were known by various names over the centuries, including Asia Minor, Anatolia and eastern Thrace. But Turkey formally became the Republic of Türkiye (Türkiye Cumhuriyeti) after independence in 1923, following the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate. In Ankara, as elsewhere, identity is everything. More prosaically, it is suggested the word turkey conjured up unwelcome images of Thanksgiving dinners and the Christian feast of Christmas. Worse, in American slang, a turkey is a silly, foolish person. Constantinople, formerly Byzantium, now goes by the less exotic name of Istanbul, which brings us back to Tur-key-yah."

Anadolu Agency said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson to UN secretary general António Guterres, confirmed receipt of the letter from Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, the Turkish foreign minister. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government has been pressing for the internationally recognised name Turkey to be changed to Türkiye (tur-key-YAY) as it is spelled and pronounced in Turkish. In December 2021, Erdoğan ordered the use of Türkiye to better represent Turkish culture and values, including demanding that “Made in Türkiye” be used instead of “Made in Turkey” on exported products. Turkish ministries also began using Türkiye in official documents. The Turkish presidency’s directorate of communications said it launched the campaign “to promote more effectively the use of ‘Türkiye’ as the country’s national and international name on international platforms”. Turkey’s English-language state broadcaster TRT World has switched to using Türkiye although the word Turkey slips in, used by journalists still trying to get used to the change. TRT World explained the decision in an article earlier this year, saying Googling “Turkey” brings up a “a muddled set of images, articles, and dictionary definitions that conflate the country with Meleagris – otherwise known as the turkey, a large bird native to North America – which is famous for being served on Christmas menus or Thanksgiving dinners.” The network continued: “Flip through the Cambridge Dictionary and ‘turkey’ is defined as ‘something that fails badly’ or ‘a stupid or silly person’.” TRT World argued that Turks prefer their country to be called Türkiye, in “keeping with the country’s aims of determining how others should identify it”."

The plate glass window of the conference room faces directly onto the hillside of Kasımpaşa, the Istanbul district where the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, grew up, and his presence as well as that of his Justice and Development party (AKP) were felt even in the conference room of İmamoğlu appointees loyal to the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP). İmamoğlu strives to position himself as Erdoğan’s opposite, an erudite and committed social democrat, despite their shared roots on Turkey’s Black Sea coast. To his critics, he has been too eager to grab power, strengthening his public profile with a visit to the Munich security conference or creating an unofficial partnership between Istanbul and Athens, still the capital of an ancient enemy for many in the Turkish government. But for his supporters, he represents Turkey’s best hope of challenging Erdoğan’s two-decade rule and the country’s slide towards autocracy, including the prospect that he could rise above the fray within the CHP to run for president in an election expected next year if not earlier. An Istanbul court is expected to rule this week on whether he insulted election officials, and if found guilty he risks being banned from politics altogether. Polls bear this out, showing İmamoğlu in a far better position to beat Erdoğan than the bespectacled elder statesman Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu who heads the CHP, and close to the Ankara mayor, Mansur Yavaş, who is the current frontrunner. Polls show him ahead of the party favourite, Kılıçdaroğlu, and his supporters believe he can appeal to minorities over the former nationalist Yavaş, but a presidential run would require him to vacate his seat, handing Turkey’s most populous city back to the AKP due to a quirk of electoral law. “The solution for that problem should come from Turkey’s table of six,” he says, in reference to the heads of Turkey’s opposition coalition."

Though a timeline has not been decided, military and political leaders have confirmed that an extensive operation is being prepared to move Kurdish populations away from Turkey’s southern border and assert Turkish control as deep as 18 miles into northern Syria. While not explicitly stated, the move involves moving Syrian Arabs into the new zones, in which Turkey will secure economic influence and political approval on the home front ahead of elections next year. Kurdish populations that dominated the 500-mile border are set to lose more sway after being forced from key towns during three Turkish incursions in the past five years. Plans for a new operation have taken rapid shape in recent weeks against a shifting geopolitical backdrop in Europe, where Sweden and Finland’s request to join Nato has given Turkey the chance to press its own domestic agendas. Earlier he had announced that up to 1 million Syrian refugees would be returned from Turkey. Despite its implications for regional security, the announcement has met a muted response: the US has expressed “concern” but needs Turkish support for the Nordic states’ ambitions to join the alliance. Local considerations remain paramount for Erdoğan, who has led Turkey for two decades and faces a troubled economy and potentially his toughest re-election challenge yet in 2023. The issue of Syrian refugees on Turkish soil is one domestic issue he could capitalise on, as anti-refugee sentiment runs high and moves to repatriate some long-term Syrian residents winning political favour. Turkish officials have claimed that up to 500,000 refugees have voluntarily returned to Syria in the past few years. “While refugees have been returning, some forcibly, in past years, were he to put such a plan in action it would be a gross breach of Turkey’s obligations [not to forcibly return refugees]”. “The Syrians I talk to in Istanbul or other cities, they have been living here with their families, their livelihood is here and they don’t want to go back to Syria. Another Turkish analyst, international relations expert Soli Özel of Istanbul’s Kadir Has University, said the chances of a large incursion were low."

Calling off talks between the countries, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Mitsotakis of deliberately antagonising Turkey when he addressed the US Congress during a visit last week to Washington. The decision to freeze Greek-Turkish contact ends what many had hoped would be a period of détente between the perennial foes after Mitsotakis held talks with Erdoğan in Istanbul in March. But the Turkish leader, who will run for re-election next year, said Mitsotakis had failed to keep his side of the deal. Making the historic 17 May address, the Greek leader stopped short of mentioning Turkey by name but warned Washington of the perils involved in fomenting instability in the region if arms purchasing agreements were adopted. His centre-right administration has announced a sevenfold increase in defence spending compared with last year against a backdrop of increased air incursions by Turkish jets. “There is no need to answer in the same way,” he said, expressing disbelief at the Turkish leader’s reaction to a speech that had, he claimed, not deviated from any of the positions Greece has long held. But a strategic shift in US regional ties has also played a role in creating disquiet among Turkey’s military and political establishment. Washington’s growing desire to see Greece as a “reliable” partner – expanding its military presence in the country and signing a mutual defence accord unprecedented in scope with Athens – has irked Ankara, analysts say, noting Erdoğan’s unpredictability. On Monday, the Turkish leader raised the issue, saying: “At this moment there are 10 bases in Greece. Turkey’s media has gone further, predicting a military attack being launched from one of the installations. Kostas Ifantis, a Turkish affairs specialist who heads the institute of international relations at Athens’ Panteion University, said with a détente now “stillborn” the coming months could be a rollercoaster."

At his press conference on Monday, he made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, initially hoped that something had got lost in translation after she had been quoted in the Turkish press saying the Turks regard all Kurds as terrorists. It was also being said that no early warning flares were sent up by Turkey’s Nato ambassador, Basat Öztürk. Eyal added: “Many of his demands about the PKK are part of a familiar Turkish tune. On Monday, the Turkish justice ministry identified six alleged PKK members it is seeking to extradite from Finland and 11 from Sweden. Add in people accused by Turkey of supporting the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt, and Turkey wants 12 people returned from Finland and 21 from Sweden. Nordic diplomats say this list was last presented in 2017 and has not been the subject of any Turkish lobbying in recent years. Turkish media has reported what it describes as other examples of a “soft” Swedish attitude to terrorism, including evidence that the Syrian branch of the PKK has held meetings in Stockholm hosted by the Swedish foreign office and the Olof Palme International Center, a thinktank funded by Swedish trade unions. Turkey also says that in 2019 PKK supporters held a protest in a shopping centre in support of the jailed leader Abdullah Öcalan and Swedish security forces did nothing to prevent them from carrying the PKK’s “flag” and pictures of Öcalan. Turkey’s 2017 purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defence system turned it into a pariah in the US and led to Ankara being kicked out of the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme."

Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has repeatedly said the two countries would be welcomed “with open arms”, but their applications must be approved by all the alliance’s 30 members and Turkey seems set to throw a spanner in the works. Ankara has said it will not support the bids, citing Sweden and Finland’s history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups and decisions in 2019 to impose arms export embargos on Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Niinistö said in an address to Swedish MPs on Tuesday that Turkey’s stance had “changed very quickly and become harder during the last few days”, but he was sure “constructive discussions” would resolve the situation. The Finnish president said his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had backed the applications when they spoke a month ago, but in the past week “he has said, ‘not favourable’. Andersson said Sweden was “looking forward to having a bilateral dialogue with Turkey. I see when both Sweden and Turkey are members of Nato, there are also opportunities to develop bilateral relations between our countries.” Erdoğan on Monday said Ankara would oppose the applications and there was no point diplomats even coming to Ankara to discuss it. Turkey alleges Finland and Sweden shelter people it says are linked to groups it designates as terrorist. While it is unclear how serious an obstacle Turkey’s objections will prove, many analysts believe Erdoğan, who faces elections next year, was seeking concessions for domestic political advantage and will not ultimately veto the Nordic nations’ applications. Borrell added that he hoped Nato would overcome Turkey’s objections. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, also said that while it was important that members talk “intensively” with Turkey, she was sure Ankara would be won over. “I am convinced Turkey will also be convinced of that.”"

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said diplomatic delegations from the two countries, which have reversed decades of military non-alignment in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, should not even bother coming to Ankara to discuss the move. “We will not say yes to those [countries] that apply sanctions to Turkey to join the security organisation Nato,” Erdoğan said. “They say they will come to Turkey on Monday. The Turkish president’s comments came as Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said “a broad majority” in parliament backed Nato membership as “the best thing for the security of Sweden” – drawing a warning from Moscow. Ankara first raised objections to Finnish and Swedish membership on Friday, citing their history of hosting members of Kurdish militant groups and Sweden’s suspension of arms sales to Turkey since 2019 over Ankara’s military operation in Syria. The justice ministry said on Monday that over the past five years the two countries had failed to respond positively to extradition requests for 33 people Turkey says are linked to groups it deems terrorist, namely the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and followers of Fethullah Gülen. Turkey’s objections, even if aimed at extracting concessions, could delay the process. The Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Monday that Stockholm was working hard to overcome Ankara’s reservations, while the foreign ministry said the Swedish and Finnish foreign ministers, Ann Linde and Pekka Haavisto, would travel “soon” to Turkey for talks. “I’m confident we will be able to address the concerns Turkey has expressed in a way that doesn’t delay the membership,” Stoltenberg said on Sunday."

Polls indicate that Erdoğan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) are likely to face stiff opposition after a year in which Turkey’s currency has halved in value and inflation has reached close to 70%. Speaking in Istanbul the same evening, the CHP leader, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, addressed Erdoğan directly.

Ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey had been mostly severed since October 2018, when a team of assassins, most of them security aides to Prince Mohammed, flew to Istanbul to ambush and dismember the Saudi dissident inside the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. But the murder was taped by Turkish spies and the ensuing investigation led to the heart of Prince Mohammed’s court, resulting in Erdoğan boycotting the defacto leader and rebuffing billions of dollars in compensation offered by Saudi envoys. It also amplified a faultline at the time between an alliance of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, on one hand, and an opposing bloc of Qatar, Turkey and the remnants of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood on the other. For more than three years, the two sides dug in, and Erdoğan rarely missed a moment to embarrass the Saudi heir, or to assert Ankara as a regional counterweight to Riyadh. Last year a view started to take shape in Turkey that it had reaped little advantage from its standoff with Riyadh. If there was to be detente, however, one problem needed to be fixed; the ongoing in trial in absentia in Istanbul of Khashoggi’s accused killers. Earlier this month, Prince Mohammed got his wish when a Turkish prosecutor decided to stop the trial. “My visit is the manifestation of our common will to start a new era of cooperation as two brotherly countries,” Erdoğan said before leaving Istanbul. Erdoğan’s trip had capped Turkey’s ambitions to play more of a regional role, one official told the Guardian."

Osman Kavala, 64, has been held since October 2017 on accusations of financing the protests which began as small demonstrations in an Istanbul park and snowballed into nationwide anti-government unrest. The sentencing marks Turkish authorities’ deepest and most public crackdown on dissent and freedom of assembly in the past decade and threatens to damage Turkish relations with Europe after heavy criticism of the marathon trial. “It’s a horrifying decision, and not one that was in any way expected,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, speaking from outside the courtroom. “It’s completely in defiance of Turkey’s obligations to international law,” said Webb. Kavala appeared in court via video link from Silivri high security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. “After losing four and a half years of my life, the only aspect I can find solace in is the possibility that what I experienced could contribute to confronting the crucial problems in the judiciary of Turkey, and so those tried in future could receive better treatment.” Small protests against an urban development plan in Istanbul’s Gezi Park that began in 2013 quickly transformed into huge anti-government protests. Kavala was accused of financing the protests after he paid for a folding table and some snacks for protesters, and arrested in the Istanbul airport in 2017. Last October, Turkey declared 10 western ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, “persona non grata”, after they issued a statement condemning Kavala’s continued detention, before later reversing the decision. The trial was repeatedly condemned as unjust and politically motivated by rights groups as well as the Council of Europe, whose ministers took the highly unusual decision earlier this year to formally begin the process of accusing Turkey of infringement, after Turkish authorities refused to release Kavala after a ruling by the European court of human rights. “It is regrettable that the Turkish authorities have refused to execute the respective ECHR’s ruling. Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU’s concerns regarding Turkish judiciary’s adherence to international and European standards,” they said."

Kafadar has been wrenched out of retirement by Turkey’s economic crisis – his pension is no longer enough to cover his basic expenses. Turkey is weathering an unprecedented financial crisis. When Turkey’s official inflation rate broke 50% in February, it represented both a two-decade high and a huge political problem for the government. The finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, insisted earlier this month that the surge was “temporary”, while Erdoğan recently vowed to protect Turks against inflation. “As the Turkish economy is getting ready to become one of the world’s top 10 economies, we have said that we will not waste this opportunity with careless and thoughtless steps,” he said. Spiralling inflation is tied to the government’s efforts to radically overhaul the Turkish economy, keeping interest rates low in the belief that this will stimulate it and increase production – against the advice of most experts. There have also been frequent changes in key personnel at the central bank – Turkey has now had four central bank chiefs in three years. “Yes, everyone is experiencing inflation worldwide, but Turkey is experiencing it at almost four or five times the rate of others,” says Alp Erinç Yeldan, an economist at Istanbul’s Kadir Has University. The independent economic research group Enag, which monitors Turkey’s inflation rate using the same metrics as the government, calculates real inflation was 142.63% in March. Turkey’s financial crisis has been further compounded by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has driven up global food prices, particularly for wheat. The lira’s slide against the dollar was already affecting Turkey’s ability to import wheat, but the loss of Ukrainian supplies has left it scrambling to find alternatives, including dipping into its own reserves. Turkey’s efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine – catapulting Erdoğan back on to the world stage as a statesman rather than an aspiring autocrat – has helped deflect some of the criticism."

The veteran leader faces an election next year in which Turkey’s stagnating economy is likely to feature prominently, and his moves in the Middle East are aimed at boosting trade and investment ties that could ease the downturn. The Khashoggi case had been an obstacle to warmer political ties, and Riyadh had made clear to Ankara that a thaw could only come with an end to the continuing exposure of the 2018 slaying. “It has a lot to do with Turkey’s strategic isolation in the Middle East […] But also Turkey giving him a pass on this is related to Erdoğan’s economic vision. “He wants to open Turkey for business, which is why he’s courting Russian oligarchs and why he has reset with the Emiratis and it’s why he’s reaching out to Saudi too.

The move has been broadly seen as a political offering ahead of a mooted visit by Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Saudi Arabia in search of renewed trade and investment to boost Ankara’s ailing economy. The prosecutor leading the case asked an Istanbul court on Thursday for the cases of the 26 suspects to be handed over to Riyadh and claimed there was little point in pursuing a trial in absentia. In the years since, Turkey had mostly maintained a hardline stance against Riyadh and demanded justice for Khashoggi as well as unspecified repatriations. Khashoggi’s former fiance, Hatice Cengiz, took to Twitter to confirm the Turkish move. “The prosecutor asked, according to the Saudi demand, for the transfer of the file to Saudi Arabia and the finalisation of it in Turkey,” she said. Listening devices planted by Turkish intelligence recorded Khashoggi being ambushed once inside by security officials who strangled, then dissected him. His remains have never been found, however intelligence offices in Turkey and the US believed his body parts were driven to the nearby Consul General’s residence and cooked in an outdoor oven. “The Turkish prosecutor has worked on this investigation and prosecution for more than three years,” she said. The Saudi system failed again and again to cooperate with the Turkish prosecutor. “If the prosecutor request is granted, then Turkey will knowingly be sending the case to a country where justice simply cannot be delivered."

Emmanuel Macron continues his dogged round of phone calls with Vladimir Putin, but it is the Turkish foreign ministry that seems able to bring the Ukrainians and Russians together. Turkey, a Nato member, continues to supply weapons to Ukraine, while refusing to impose sanctions on Russia, and yet is apparently respected enough by both sides to host Tuesday’s talks. The Turks also have a profound sense of what may be at stake. Speaking at the weekend in Doha, Ibrahim Kalin, the adviser and spokesperson to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spelled it out: “Once this is all over, there will have to be a new security architecture to emerge globally. It would also be wrong to think Turkey does not have its own point of view. Turkey may even provide a role model of sorts, he suggested, refusing to choose between east and west – something he said Turkey had been forced to do due to its geography. After a long period offending many in the region, Turkey – perhaps driven by economic weakness – has been mending fences. The initial Turkey-hosted meeting, between Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, took place earlier this month, on the fringes of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. But at the talks on Tuesday in Istanbul, initially slated to last two days, the Ukrainian offer became more explicit, and was delivered in writing. Podolyak said Ukraine wanted to see China, Russia, the US, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada and Israel as the guarantor states. Podolyak claimed “preliminary acceptance came from some countries that we wanted to be guarantor countries”, adding he thought ground existed for a meeting hosted by Turkey, a goal alongside a humanitarian ceasefire the Turkish foreign minister said was achievable. But Turkey is more optimistic and thinks there is a plan capable of gaining traction. Turkey’s next aim is to get Volodymyr Zelenskiy  and Putin in the same room in the next fortnight."

He was present on Tuesday at both the formal Turkey-hosted morning talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace and the informal huddle at the adjacent Shangri-La in the afternoon.

Thousands of Russians have fled the country since the invasion of Ukraine, many for Turkey as well as Finland, Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, where the government claims that up to 25,000 people have crossed the border in recent weeks. Istanbul has proved a popular choice, either for transit or a new home, as the closure of European airspace to Russian flights makes Turkey one of the few remaining hubs left that can serve as an escape route. Many of those arriving in Istanbul are millennials who grew up in a post-cold war Russia, part of a middle class that was used to international travel and working in industries deeply socially and economically intertwined with the outside world. The couple have no idea whether they will be living in Istanbul for three weeks, or three years. Russian rapper Oxxxymiron organised a charity concert in Istanbul entitled Russians Against War. Arsen felt he had no choice but to leave, and is trying to make peace with his newfound existence in Istanbul. “By the time I got to Istanbul, my friends in Tbilisi sent me messages telling me not to come,” said Arsen.

Turkey is the third biggest exporter of counterfeit products to the EU after China and Hong Kong, according to data on the value of goods seized. Falls in the value of the Turkish lira and the deterioration of the Turkish economy are further fuelling demand as such items become cheaper to traders buying in euros. It’s such a good deal if you earn in dollars or euros,” the Turkish store owner said. The value of counterfeits from Turkey more than tripled from 2019 to 2020, reaching nearly €134m (£111m), and Turkey became the main source of fake designer clothing and medicine stopped at EU borders, surpassing China in these categories. “We see fakes booming when the economy does badly,” said Zeynep Seda Alhas, who specialises in intellectual property rights at Gün + Partners, a law firm in Istanbul representing some of the world’s most famous brands. In January, it conducted what Alhas called “the biggest raid in Turkey’s history”, confiscating more than 350,000 pairs of fake designer trainers in three Istanbul workshops, some half-finished and all destined to be eventually sent abroad. Turkey’s legal exports have also surged during the currency crisis, increasing 33% over the year and reaching $225bn (£171bn), according to the government-run Turkish Statistical Institute. “There’s no reason why counterfeit goods’ exports would increase any less than legal exports,” said Ümit İzmen, a former chief economist of TÜSİAD, Turkey’s leading business association. Law firms such as Alhas’s usually hear about big shipments caught by customs officers – mostly in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands – and then try to find the production site in Turkey. The website of neighbouring Bulgaria’s customs authority is packed with reports of vehicles from Turkey caught with counterfeit goods. A producer of fake Dsquared2 jeans said there were freight companies in Istanbul that focused on counterfeit exports, filling trucks with fakes surrounded by originals."

This is a key route for asylum seekers – mostly Afghans – into Turkey and beyond, which is why the wall that snakes along the border is sometimes described as a gateway to Europe. Perhaps the saddest moment in Turkey came as I kneeled on the floor of a play area in a deportation centre, watching a toddler run repeatedly up the green plastic steps of a dinosaur slide and then sliding down. After a harrowing journey into Iran, smugglers took thousands of dollars, only to drop her at a crossing into Turkey they knew was impossible. Then they just ran, to escape the Turkish police.

Erdoğan was also given warning, since he needed to use Turkish airspace. Turkey has also been accused of shopping on both sides of the street. The country is battling a financial crisis and has not imposed sanctions or closed Turkish airspace to Russia, even though it has condemned the invasion unambiguously, allowed Turkish-built drones to be bought by the Ukrainian army and closed the Bosporus and Dardanelles under the 1936 Montreux Pact, allowing it, if necessary, to prevent some Russian warships from crossing the Turkish straits. Criticism inside Turkey of Erdoğan has been less intense than of Bennett, but it is noticeable that Boris Johnson spoke to Erdoğan by phone on Friday and Wendy Sherman, the US deputy secretary of state, met Turkish officials that day. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian opposite number Dmytro Kuleba have agreed to meet at a forum in southern Turkey on Thursday, the first potential talks between the top diplomats since Russia launched its invasion. The Russian president once said of his Turkish counterpart: “This is a person who keeps his word – a man.” Its tourism sector relies heavily on 5 million Russian visitors annually, and Russia is overseeing Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear plant in Mersin province. Gazprom owns Turkstream, the gas pipeline from Russia that meets 40% of Turkish demand. For Turkey’s right wing, what is at stake is not Europe’s future, but Turkey’s as an ascending power. But Turkey is also a Nato member, looking for a way back with the US, and is Ukraine’s fifth biggest trading partner.

Turkey has so far made no public statements on closing the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier on Saturday, stating that Ankara is attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire. Turkish officials have briefed no decision has been taken and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russia has received no official notification from the Turkish side about a closure. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases. Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention. The convention defines Turkish control of the straits as well as setting limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted. Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to the daily newspaper Hürriyet, stating that officials are discussing whether the conflict meets the definition of a war under the Montreux convention. “Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed”. Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions. Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”. The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits is likely to heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent."

Lily Faraji, Zeinab Sahafi and Ismail Fattahi were arrested after attending a protest in the southern Turkish city of Denizli last March. Hundreds of protesters across Turkey have faced brutal responses from local police for participating in demonstrations against Turkey’s withdrawal from the convention, which aims to combat violence against women by supporting survivors of abuse. “They were taken from their homes because they joined in the Istanbul convention protests,” said Bergamalı, adding that the four were arrested after police photographed them at the protests and identified them. Turkish authorities ruled earlier this month that the group could be deported, after they lost their appeal against a deportation order issued last April. The order to deport the group comes amid rising concern over Turkey’s treatment of Iranian dissidents and asylum seekers in Turkey, who number at least 24,300, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR). An estimated 67,000 Iranian citizens live in Turkey, with numbers reportedly rising in recent years as some flee persecution while others look to avoid US sanctions on Iran by buying property and claiming Turkish citizenship. Bergamalı said the four Iranians she represents have been fighting to remain in Turkey, even as conditions for Iranian citizens worsen. “They came to Turkey to survive. Iranian dissidents in Turkey have increasingly raised the alarm that they are no longer safe in a country formerly regarded as a safe haven. Turkish authorities initially said Shariatmadari had been arrested because her visa had expired and she could be deported to Iran, where rights groups said she faced torture or even the death penalty. After a public outcry, Shariatmadari was allowed to renew her Turkish visa and released. Eleven Iranian citizens, including a former employee of the Iranian consulate in Istanbul, are on trial for involvement in the murder of Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, an Iranian dissident in Turkey known for his social media posts criticising corruption within the Islamic Republic.

The Italian authorities worked with the UN refugee agency, the Turkish authorities and Caritas, which is offering food and a home to the Syrian family in a small village near Siena. In the end, the Catholic church negotiated the passage of Mustafa and his family through Turkey, thanks to a humanitarian corridor, which allows for legal passage across countries, perhaps one of the most effective models for avoiding asylum seeker deaths and suffering, but unfortunately rarely used by European countries. Munzir plays with him every day here in Italy, surrounded by the beautiful Tuscan hills, which have taken the place of the decaying, grey buildings of the Turkish-Syrian border."

Turkey said that as a Nato member it was legitimate to provide weapons against a country that might threaten other Nato states in eastern Europe. “Military cooperation between Ankara and Kyiv is not intended to target Russia and won’t be disrupted in order to please it,” a senior Turkish presidential official said."
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/turkish-president-erdogan-mediate-ukraine-russia,Erdoğan offers to mediate between Ukraine and Russia,3 Feb 2022 06.00 CET,"Turkish president faces delicate balancing act in supporting Ukraine while maintaining Moscow relations The Turkish president and wild card of Nato diplomacy, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will fly to Kyiv on Thursday to offer himself again in the role of mediator between Ukraine and the Russian president Vladimir Putin. With Turkey’s Nato membership often under challenge, partly due to its decision to buy the Russian-made S-400 air-defence system, Erdoğan faces a difficult balancing act in showing continued strong diplomatic support for Ukraine while not damaging his complex long-term relations with Moscow. In a sign of the visit’s importance, Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, and Ibrahim Kalin, chief adviser to the president of Turkey, spoke on Tuesday about their commitment to “deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine”, according to a White House statement. Putin criticised Turkey last year when it sold its Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian army. The sale led to an official complaint from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Turkey was feeding militarist tendencies. Iliya Kuva from the Ukrainian Institute of the Future said: “The drones have a pretty huge psychological and political impact on Ukrainian public opinion since Turkey is seen as the country that provides weapons that are modern and good enough to maintain a military balance with Russian forces in the east.” On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians have been angered by TurkStream, a gas pipeline inaugurated in 2020. The pipeline takes gas from Russia to Turkey via the Black Sea in a manner that weakens Ukraine’s role as a transit country for Russian gas, in the same way that Nord Stream 2 will if Germany declares it has passed regulatory hurdles. In a bid to reassure Moscow before Erdoğan’s visit, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, stressed Ankara’s commitment to the 1936 Montreux Convention, the treaty that strictly restricts Nato forces’ access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus. The convention regulates maritime traffic through Turkey’s Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – the link between the Mediterranean and Black seas. During the confrontation in Georgia, Turkey refused to let US warships into the Black Sea as part of US moves to deter Russia. Turkey’s turbulent relations with Moscow in Libya and Syria show two countries often in direct conflict but not eager to see relations break down, let alone spill into direct military action."

After the bodies were found on Wednesday, Ankara’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, accused Greek guards of deliberately pushing the refugees back across the border. Soylu said the dead had been among a group of 22 people pushed back into Turkey, and shared blurry photographs of eight of the recovered bodies, including three in just shorts and T-shirts. “The death of 12 migrants at the Turkish border near Ipsala is a tragedy. Any suggestion they did, or indeed were pushed back into Turkey, is utter nonsense.” Mitarachi said that instead of making “baseless claims” Ankara should uphold its commitment to stop such “dangerous journeys”, referring to a deal reached between the EU and Turkey to stem migrant flows. “Turkey should assume its responsibilities if we want to prevent such tragedies from occurring again,” he said. But officials in the Turkish border city of Edirne clarified that among the dead was a migrant who had submitted to frostbite after being rushed to the local hospital. But friction over the problem has worsened since early 2020, when a border crisis erupted after Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, encouraged thousands of asylum seekers to enter Europe via Greece. While Turkey hosts about 3.7 million Syrian refugees and is regarded as a major transit route for those fleeing poverty and war in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, Greece is seen as the easiest gateway into the EU. Since Athens reinforced Aegean sea borders after the 2020 crisis, growing numbers of refugees have elected to cross into the country via its north-eastern land frontier with Turkey, despite Greek authorities also erecting a 40km steel wall last year along the border."

Altcointurk’s all-male inhabitants were not worried – in the chaotic world of cryptocurrency, their fortunes could soon change. But the target is always getting rich – although a lot of people think that if they invest a hundred dollars, they will get a million,” said one founder of Altcointurk known only as Shark, who pointedly added that he has trademarked his nickname. Altcointurk was founded to teach Turkish citizens about how to invest in cryptocurrencies, which provide a digital, decentralised alternative to the mainstream financial system. Cryptocurrency trading has boomed in popularity in Turkey during a financial crisis that halved the value of the lira last year, while inflation recently surged above 30%, a two-decade high. While most Turkish citizens looking to avoid the devaluation of their savings in lira tend to reinvest in dollars or gold, an increasing number of younger investors see cryptocurrencies as the way forward. This has drawn the ire of the government, particularly President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who declared that “we are in a war against Bitcoin” and recently unveiled a programme to encourage Turkish citizens to switch their savings to lira and stash the cash in the banks. To cryptocurrency believers, the increasing lack of trust in government solutions is proof that digital currencies are the best alternative to Turkey’s embattled lira. Evangelists such as the Altcointurk founders say that if the influx of unknowing investors risk falling prey to scams or simply wasting their money, it is the fault of the individual. Altcointurk members – by their own estimates – have trained more than 300 people since the hub started five years ago, and more attend a weekly event they host to preach the wonders of crypto. Cryptocurrencies exist in a legal grey area in Turkey."

The closure of Istanbul Airport – where the roof of one of the cargo terminals collapsed under heavy snow, causing no injuries – grounded flights stretching from the Middle East and Africa to Europe and Asia. Travel officials told AFP it marked the airport’s first shutdown since it replaced Istanbul’s old Ataturk Airport as the new hub for Turkish Airlines in 2019. The winter’s first snow proved a major headache for the 16 million residents of Turkey’s largest city, where cars ploughed into each other, skidding down steep, sleet-covered streets and highways turned into parking lots. The Istanbul governor’s office warned drivers they would not be able to enter the city from Thrace – a region stretching across the European part of Turkey to its western border with Bulgaria and Greece. The storm blocked roads across central and southeastern Turkey before crossing into neighbouring Syria, where it piled more misery on the war-scarred country’s northern refugee camps. Istanbul Airport serviced more than 37 million passengers last year, becoming one of the world’s most important air hubs. Most of Turkey’s main institutions stayed open."

Since June, Afghans, Syrians, Somalis, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have been denied the right to seek refugee status, with Athens saying they should apply for asylum in neighbouring Turkey.

The overhaul is aimed as much at strengthening the nation’s war readiness against Turkey as reinforcing its security role on Nato’s south-eastern flank. Tensions over rival claims to offshore gas reserves in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war in 2020. Ankara’s recent economic woes, in the wake of the country’s currency crisis, has also caused nervousness in Athens. “Aside from the perennial antagonism between Greece and Turkey, both also want to upgrade their role within Nato because of the diplomatic and political consequences that will bring,” said Michaletos.

The economy is in freefall, thanks to the self-declared republic’s financial and political dependence on Turkey. Thousands have taken to the streets, spurred by inflation rates that have left many struggling to make ends meet; ahead of parliamentary polls later this month, calls for a boycott are mounting, while a blacklist of Turkish Cypriot dissidents, reportedly drawn up at the behest of Ankara, has spawned consternation and fear. “Turkey is our biggest problem,” says Elcil, who heads the Turkish Cypriot teachers’ union and is a vocal proponent of reunification of the war-divided island under a federal umbrella with the Greek-run south. Elcil, 58, is among the statelet’s most outspoken opponents of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his unorthodox economic policies. The recent gyrations of the Turkish lira – adopted by the territory in 1976, two years after the Turkish invasion – have had a devastating effect on daily life for a populace that remains under international embargo and cut off from the rest of the world. “Tatar is Ankara’s puppet who was elected only after Turkey intervened in our democratic process. In the 38 years since the breakaway republic unilaterally declared independence, Turkey’s interference in the entity’s affairs had never been as flagrant, claimed Izcan, echoing a widely voiced concern. “Elections are no longer representative of the real will of ordinary Turkish Cypriots. They’re like a game planned and played by Turkey,” the former MP said. Our economic difficulties are the result of a political situation, of Turkey continuing its military occupation of the north by means of the lira.”Cyprus has been split between a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north since an Athens-backed coup, aimed at union with Greece, prompted Ankara to launch a military operation to seize its northern third. Although Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of reunification in a referendum in 2004, the island entered the EU as a divided state after its majority Greek Cypriot population rejected the prospect of power sharing. The growing disgruntlement follows alarm over the deportation from Turkey of prominent Turkish Cypriots opposed to Ankara’s policies."

Arriving in Turkey in late 2020, shortly before a ban on mixed plastic waste imports came into force, the containers quickly became the centre of a battle between traders, a shipping line, multiple governments and environmental campaigners demanding their return. Turkish authorities refused entry to the containers, leaving them in limbo. But then we found out their import licence was cancelled, and they were blacklisted by Turkey. Lab tests showed some loads in the containers are hazardous city waste,” said Omer Bulduk of Monax, a Turkish freight company assigned to receive the containers. In May, the Turkish foreign ministry contacted their counterparts in Germany to demand the containers’ return. Angela Griesbach, a spokesperson for the waste management authority in the state of Baden-Württemberg, now in charge of overseeing the containers, said this was “probably a misunderstanding”, adding that the containers contained waste that was legal when it arrived in Turkey. “There’s also almost a hundred containers sitting in Turkey, and we’re very worried they will be bound for countries like Vietnam,” he added. If certain conditions were met, she added, the containers in Turkey could be returned. “If the problem is not an internal Turkish enforcement problem, the German authorities, as well as the German company voluntarily, are willing to take back this waste in accordance with the law. However, this requires the corresponding cooperation and information from the Turkish side.” The Turkish environment ministry did not respond when contacted for comment on the issue. Vietnam and Turkey are two of a growing number of countries that have reported a sudden spike in plastic waste, after China’s decision to ban waste imports in 2018 proved to be a watershed for the global trade. Matthew Gordon, an environmental researcher at Yale University who is part of a team compiling an “atlas of plastic waste” to show new plastic dumping sites across the world, said he was surprised by the number of countries represented in their initial findings, including Bosnia, Thailand, Romania, Malaysia and Turkey."

Many of Turkey’s leading financial figures agree, and the country has had four central bank chiefs in the past two and half years, while former finance minister Lütfi Elvan quit at the beginning of December. He repeatedly encouraged Turks to take their money out from under their mattresses and put it into banks.

If customers have lots of cash to offload through gold sales, he says, he calls traders in Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar and arranges a private sale. Most of his customers prefer dollars, so much so that some are changing Turkish marriage traditions and pinning foreign currency to brides rather than the traditional gold coins. “About 70% of the customers are Turks, buying in panic. Maybe they have debts they want to get rid of,” he adds, leaning in to whisper: “Turks are buying a lot.” Turkey’s stock market, the Borsa, was twice forced to halt trading to prevent further losses. “In Turkey, the root cause of the financial turmoil is the loose monetary policy itself.

When the man’s passport was scanned during border procedures, it flagged a warrant issued by Turkey, which triggered the arrest. Investigations have named a man called Khalid Aedh al-Otaibi as one of the “commando” group at the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul where Khashoggi was killed on 2 October 2018.

The film is a startling, sensitively made exposé of the murderous misogyny and dangerous politics behind an epidemic of femicide in Turkey, a country where an astonishing one in three women is subjected to some form of domestic violence. The pair, who met at university in Bristol, joined together to make the documentary after Fairweather met Arzu when she was filming another project in Turkey. Since then, she and Kirwan have conquered a series of challenges, including repeated battles for funds and lengthy delays imposed by a glacial Turkish legal system. I’m so pleased it’s been chosen as an Academy Award contender by Bafta, partly because, although it is such an important story, it would have been very risky for it to be made inside Turkey by film-makers there.” At the heart of Fairweather’s documentary is the work of Ipek Bozkurt, the campaigning Turkish lawyer and activist who has guided both Kubra and Arzu, along with many others, through the painful aftermath of appalling injuries, helping them courageously press charges against their husbands. Bozkurt is in Britain this weekend for the premiere, and she told the Observer she remains determined to fight back against prejudices in the Turkish criminal justice system, working alongside her comrades on the anti-femicide platform she has established with other Turkish lawyers as a support for survivors and victims’ families across the country. “It is amazing how quickly things have changed in Turkey,” Bozkurt said. At first, her relatives in Turkey, where they returned to live, celebrated the match. It is certainly revealing of the cultural environment that gives Turkish husbands what Bozkurt calls “effective impunity” for whatever violence they see fit to mete out to their wives. For Bozkurt, “the personal is political”, and in Turkey the link is pretty direct. The film shows her campaigning against legal changes introduced by Turkey’s autocratic president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and features recent news footage of a political rally in which traditional Turkish cultural ideals about the sanctity of mothers are used to imply that all women should stay at home."

The court’s decision paves the way for the Council of Europe to launch infringement proceedings against Turkey. Kavala has been incarcerated without being convicted for more than four years, prompting claims of political persecution against the businessman amid international criticism of Ankara’s crackdown on opponents. “This trial is yet another brazen episode in the relentless political persecution for which the European court has condemned Turkey,” said Nils Muižnieks, Amnesty International’s Europe director. The Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, warned Turkey in September it would begin proceedings unless it released Kavala before a ministerial meeting next week. The process could lead to Turkey’s membership or voting rights being suspended, further isolating Ankara and threatening a key link to Europe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, threatened to expel the envoys before backing down. Turkey maintained he was being held according to the rulings of its independent judiciary. Kavala did not attend Friday’s hearing at the Istanbul 13th high criminal court. He having previously said his presence via video link from Istanbul’s Silivri prison was “meaningless” and a fair trial “no longer possible”. Turkey’s fractured relations with the west partly stem from criticism of its human rights record since the failed coup in which 250 were people killed and a foreign policy that has often put it at odds with fellow Nato members. Ankara is also facing an economic crisis in which the lira hit record lows over the last two months, losing 20% of its value in November."

The alert came after the Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said his government would use the three-day event in Istanbul to persuade the international criminal police organisation’s officials and delegates to find, arrest and extradite Turkish dissident citizens – particularly those it labels terrorists – abroad. Turkish authorities have been accused of repeatedly swamping the police organisation with requests targeting political opponents. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told the opening session of the 89th Interpol general assembly on Tuesday that he expected “strong cooperation” in the extradition of people suspected of following the US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen and the PKK, the Kurdish movement. Interpol has rejected almost 800 red notice requests from Turkey in the past five years, an Interpol spokesperson told the Guardian, insisting that each request was rigorously checked. But critics from the Turkish Democracy Project claim some exiles have been unjustly threatened with arrest and extradition by the organisation. In August, the Stockholm Center for Freedom, a non-profit advocacy organisation promoting the rule of law, democracy and human rights and focusing on Turkey, accused the Erdoğan regime of having “weaponised” Interpol for its wider campaign of repression against critics, human rights activists and ethnic or religious minorities abroad. It added: “Turkey abuses Interpol in various ways. “Turkey is also accused of manipulating Interpol’s Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database (SLTD) by filing tens of thousands of cases for critics and opponents who, in many instances, are not even aware that their passports have been invalidated.” Madeleine Joelson, executive director of the Turkish Democracy Project, said: “Interpol – once a bastion of law and order – has become a tool of transnational repression."

Jason Tuvey, a Turkey expert at the consultancy Capital Economics, said that in the run-up to the 2018 election campaign, interest rates fell and the economy boomed, yet the lira fell, ushering in high inflation.

Pamuk, who denies the accusations, published the book in Turkey in March. The first complaint against the book – set on a fictional Ottoman island during an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the early 1900s – came in April, when a lawyer accused Pamuk of inciting “hatred and animosity” by insulting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and ridiculing the flag of Turkey in the work. An Istanbul court decided not to take the claim forward due to lack of evidence, but the lawyer who brought the case, Tarcan Ülük, appealed against the decision and the investigation has now been reopened. Pamuk was previously prosecuted for “insulting Turkishness” after raising the 1915 killings of Armenians and Kurds in an interview. Law 5816, under which Pamuk is now being investigated, is intended to protect “the memory of Atatürk” from insult by any Turkish citizen. “Orhan Pamuk is Turkey’s national treasure, a literary asset whose words reverberate across the globe and should be celebrated as such, yet he finds himself once again targeted for his writings,” said PEN International president Burhan Sönmez. “The Turkish authorities have repeatedly used criminal defamation laws to silence those who dare to speak out, and this case is no exception.” “The reopening of the investigation, despite the lack of evidence and [the] initial court decision not to prosecute the case, points to the overall climate of repression against writers in Turkey and demonstrates how the legal system enables appalling authoritarian restrictions on free expression and creativity.” According to PEN America, at least 25 writers were jailed last year by the Turkish government, the third-highest number globally. The Turkish Publishers Association also called on prosecutors to drop the investigation. Daniel Gorman, Director of English PEN, said: “The fact that an investigation has been launched highlights the significant restrictions on freedom of expression faced by writers in Turkey today. We urge Turkish authorities to drop the case against him, and we continue to campaign against ongoing attempts by the Turkish government to silence writers.”"

The currency has lost a staggering 25% of its value so far this year after a series of deep interest rate cuts by Turkey’s central bank, despite three years of double-digit inflation. Turkey’s insistence on slashing the benchmark interest rate, even as other central banks around the world use higher borrowing costs to try and put a brake on inflation, reflects Erdoğan’s belief that high interest rates, which he has termed “the mother and father of all evil”, fuel higher inflation. Contrary to the view of mainstream economists, since the lira began to nosedive in 2018 the president has placed an emphasis on keeping Turkey’s economy growing with the help of cheaper borrowing costs. While the economy had a record 21.7% year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2021, middle- and low-income households – including much of the Turkish leader’s political base – are feeling the pinch. The government is reportedly preparing to raise the minimum wage and subsidise energy costs, but as Turkey’s elite profit from lower borrowing costs, widening financial inequality looks set to threaten the coalition’s chances in elections scheduled for 2023. Sinem Adar, an associate at the Centre for Applied Turkey Studies in Berlin, said: “Why do Erdoğan and the AKP willingly increase social and political costs by recklessly intervening into the central bank?"

If she had known that within a few hours of leaving Turkey she would be under arrest, accused of people trafficking herself, she would have thought twice about the journey. Soon they were in the cobalt blue water of the Aegean Sea, leaving Turkey’s Sivrice Bay behind, and heading for the Greek island of Lesbos. She met families living in temporary accommodation in Istanbul and travelled to the border town of Reyhanlı in the southern province of Hatay, near the Syrian border. “My Kurdish family were forced from south-east Turkey in 1977. Even though I was born in Istanbul and wasn’t a refugee, I felt a lack of belonging. Some of the refugees she encountered were happy to stay in Turkey, but others had dreams of making it to Europe. Stories of perilous sea crossings between Turkey and Greece began to emerge as waves of refugees risked their lives to start anew in the west. In total, more than a million migrants and refugees entered Europe in 2015, the vast majority via sea from Turkey. The tragic image of two-year-old Syrian Alan Kurdi lying face down on a Turkish beach after drowning on a sea crossing came to symbolise the desperate plight of people who dared to believe in a better future. More than 800 people died in just one year on the Turkey-Greece route that she documented. According to the International Organization for Migration, at least 3,700 migrants died trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2015 – more than 800 of them on the Turkey-Greece route that Vural documented.

Friction has risen as boats carrying migrants and refugees have set out, reportedly unhindered, from the Turkish coast despite Ankara agreeing to prevent illegal flows under a deal with the EU in 2016. Since March 2020, when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, encouraged thousands of migrants to enter Greece – triggering a crisis that would see the EU scramble to reinforce its land and sea borders – the Aegean has allegedly become a theatre for pushbacks, with human rights groups claiming that thousands have been forcibly moved into Turkish waters before getting the chance to apply for asylum. Pushbacks were among the issues at the top of the agenda when the Greek migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, held talks in Ankara this week. Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s centre-right government in Greece has vigorously rejected the claims about pushbacks – attributing them in large part to Turkish propaganda – but the leader accepts his administration pursues “tough but fair” border management policies securing the EU’s external frontier. Explaining the length of time needed to bring the cargo ship “to safe anchorage”, migration ministry officials in Athens laid the blame squarely with Ankara’s refusal to respond to repeated requests for the vessel to be sent back. Aid groups, piecing together the sequence of events, believe it was logistically impossible to push the ship back because it was so big and would have required the Greek coastguard also entering Turkish waters. Once it became clear a pushback was impossible, Athens resorted to appealing to Turkey, said Olsen, whose organisation is among a network of NGOs accused by Greek officials of aiding and abetting people smugglers – allegations he strongly rejects. “Instead of the Greek coastguard, which is a rescue service, bringing them to safety, the government chose to keep them onboard and move them around as it tried to come to a deal with Turkey."

Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, signed a military cooperation agreement on a visit to Ankara in August with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The details of the agreement have not been published, but officials told Reuters in October that Ethiopia had requested Turkey’s Bayraktar TB2 drones, considered to be the most effective munitions of their type in the world. But neither are considered as effective as Turkey’s TB2s, made by Baykar Makina, a company whose chief technology officer, Selçuk Bayraktar, is married to Erdoğan’s younger daughter. Neither government has publicly commented on the sale of drones but there is already evidence to suggest Turkish munitions are in use: a fragment of a Turkish-made laser-guided bomb found by Tigrayan forces was passed to a journalist and analyst, Martin Plaut, early last month. TB2 drones were initially used by Ankara against Kurdish separatists inside its own country and neighbouring Syria and Iraq. An increasingly assertive Ankara has rapidly stepped up exports, and last week Kyrgyzstan became the latest country to put in an order. The rapid spread of Turkey’s drone technology, and the authoritarian nature of some of the buyers, alarms some commentators."

The couple have managed to pay for a new roof and fixed glass windows that shattered in fires over two devastating weeks in August, when the blazes reached a heat intensity four times higher than Turkey’s previous record. Much has been said and written about democratic backsliding and the erasure of rule of law in Turkey during two decades of Justice and Development party (AKP) rule. But just as destructive, and much harder to fix, is the party’s addiction to concrete: the AKP has relied on large, job-heavy infrastructure projects as the engine of Turkey’s economy. But this summer, a culmination of population growth, industrialisation, urban sprawl and the climate crisis has finally made it impossible for Ankara to ignore the consequences of pursuing economic growth at the cost of everything else. According to Dr Cihan Erdönmez, a lecturer at Istanbul university’s forestry department, lessons have been learned across government after the summer fires disaster: a new fleet of planes will be established and the forestry ministry is increasing staffing levels. Large natural lakes have dried up, killing fish and birds, and rising temperatures in Istanbul’s Sea of Marmara left marine life suffocating under layers of “sea snot” released by out-of-control growth of phytoplankton. Europe’s plastic waste, sent to Turkey for recycling, has ended up illegally dumped, burned or thrown in the ocean, while the land has been scarred and polluted by the booming gold, mineral and lignite – low-quality coal – mining industries. “Turkish governments dating back to the 1970s have made national energy security and independence a primary goal as Turkey doesn’t have its own gas and black coal resources,” said Deniz Gümüsel, an environmental engineer and climate policy expert, who is camped out at a mining protest site not far from Marmaris. Despite being the globe’s 16th biggest carbon emitter and a member of the G20, Turkey has dragged its feet on implementing the 2015 international treaty over disagreements on whether it qualified for financial and technical support from wealthier nations. It emerged that the Turkish parliament took the final legal step earlier this month after Ankara was offered financial guarantees from several European countries and two development banks."

In what Greece’s migration ministry called “an unusual and special case”, the Turkish-flagged vessel was towed into the port of Kos on Sunday. Many were reported to be hungry and dehydrated after an ordeal that began on Thursday when the freighter, initially bound for Italy, developed engine trouble and sent out a distress signal off the island of Crete, shortly after setting sail from Turkey. Days of negotiations between Athens and Ankara followed after the Greek government appealed via the European Commission for Turkey to take the vessel back in line with a 2016 accord reached with the EU intended to staunch migrants flows. When the Turkish authorities made clear they would not be accepting the ship, Greek coastguard officials launched what they called one of the largest search and rescue operations in the eastern Mediterranean. The country’s minister for migration and asylum policy, Notis Mitarachi, described the incident as “another dangerous and illegal journey from the Turkish coast … facilitated by criminal gangs”. He said on Sunday: “We have notified the EU that Turkey has refused to take their vessel back. It is time for the EU to act and provide impactful solidarity and ensure the [2016] EU/Turkey statement is upheld. “Unlike Turkey and others that ignored the problem, Greece stepped up, providing immediate humanitarian support to people in need as we always do. Numbers have dropped precipitously but Athens and Ankara have been in a war of words over migrant arrivals. Turkey has repeatedly accused Greece of forcibly returning boats crammed with asylum seekers into Turkish waters by pursuing a policy of pushbacks, and has invited the international media to witness such incidents. Athens has charged Turkish authorities with deliberately escalating tension by encouraging smugglers to organise the illicit journeys. None of those onboard wanted to return to Turkey because they did not consider it a safe country, the organisation said."

The redesigned space was the scene of a flurry of activity on Friday, Turkey’s independence day: flower arrangements were hurriedly being taken inside while workers unrolled red carpets before the evening inauguration and the premiere of an opera commissioned for the occasion. Since the Republic of Turkey was founded a century ago, Taksim Square has functioned as a cultural and political hub. A massive new mosque on the opposite side of Taksim, long one of the pious Turkish leader’s pet projects, was completed earlier this year, giving an area long associated with the republic’s secular founding principles a new religious identity. The reopening of the cultural centre is seen by many in Turkey’s highly polarised society as restoring an ideological balance in an important public space. The long-awaited renovation should also be celebrated as the return of a cultural lodestar, said Gülper Refiğ, a musicology professor and longstanding figure in Turkey’s performing arts scene. “Atatürk commissioned the first Turkish opera, by Adnan Saygun in 1934, and the new one is commissioned by the president and written by one of Saygun’s students, Hasan Uçarsu, a very talented composer.” Uçarsu’s two-act opera focuses on one of the greatest artists in Ottoman history, Mimar Sinan, a prolific 16th-century architect who built Istanbul’s breathtaking Süleymaniye mosque and Edirne’s Selimiye mosque for the ruling sultans. As Turkey’s tourism industry struggles to recover from the pandemic, the municipality and the national culture ministry are seeking to cement Istanbul’s reputation as a global arts destination. The Contemporary Istanbul art fair has just successfully staged the city’s first international art event since before the Covid-19 shutdowns, and several new initiatives are on the way. Derelict shipyards on the Golden Horn are being transformed into a cultural quarter, and the new Galataport development on the Bosphorus will eventually house the new Renzo Piano-designed Istanbul Museum of Modern Art and the rehomed National Museum of Painting and Sculpture."

A mass expulsion of the ambassadors would have been an unprecedented development in relations between Nato allies, threatening to open the biggest diplomatic rift between Turkey and the west during Erdoğan’s nearly 20 years in power. While the spat appears to be de-escalating, the incident has left a sour taste for Ankara’s western partners, and reverses a year of overtures from the Turkish leader which appeared to be aimed at rapprochement with Joe Biden and European states. Both Washington and Ankara appeared to insist on Monday night that they had not backed down, with a US state department spokesperson saying that the earlier statement on adhering to Article 41 of the Vienna Convention was meant to underscore that the US envoy’s actions were in keeping with the convention’s terms. The Turkish lira – which has lost one-quarter of its value in the last 12 months – welcomed the news, pulling back from a historic low of 9.85 to the dollar to 9.607. Tensions spiked between Ankara and the US, Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and New Zealand over the weekend, when the Turkish president said he had ordered the envoys to be declared “persona non grata”, which can lead to formal expulsion. The dramatic decision was triggered by a joint statement from the ambassadors calling on Turkey to abide by a 2019 European court of human rights ruling in the high-profile case of Osman Kavala, a businessman and philanthropist who has been held in pre-trial detention for four years on terrorism charges. His next hearing is scheduled for 26 November, and the Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey by the end of next month if Kavala is not released. Monday’s climbdown came after a cabinet meeting at which ministers reportedly advised the president about the economic dangers of escalating tensions with some of Turkey’s closest allies and trading partners. In televised comments upon the meeting’s conclusion, the president said “the Turkish judiciary doesn’t take orders from anyone, and is not under anyone’s command."

Carrying out the expulsions would send Turkey’s relationships with Europe and the US to an all-time low, risk further turmoil for the Turkish lira, and accelerate Ankara’s drift away from the west. Seven of the countries involved are Turkey’s Nato allies. The ambassadors “cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders … I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done: these 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once,” Erdoğan said in a speech in the north-western city of Eskişehir. “They will know and understand Turkey. The day they do not know and understand Turkey, they will leave,” he said to cheers from the crowd. “No instructions have been given to embassies,” a Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters, adding that it was possible a decision may be taken at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Most of the countries involved have declined to comment until hearing from official Turkish channels, with the US state department saying Washington was aware of the reports and was seeking clarity from the Turkish foreign ministry. Kavala and eight other Gezi park activists facing up to 20 years in prison on terror charges were acquitted last year in a surprise ruling, but he was returned to Istanbul’s Silivri prison within hours after a new warrant for his re-arrest as part of an investigation into the failed 2016 coup. The Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey by the end of next month if Kavala is not released. Demonstrations that began over plans to turn the rare green space in central Istanbul into a shopping mall grew into nationwide protests against the then prime minister’s increasingly strong grip on Turkey. The UK has long prided itself on its close relations with Turkey, and was the first country to send a minister to Ankara after the 2016 abortive coup. The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has already found himself in hot water with Ankara after describing Erdoğan as a dictator, prompting the Turkish president to call him rude."

The body, which has 660 officers working alongside Greek counterparts at Greece’s sea, land and air borders, has admitted that the Syrian couple and their four children were among 18 passengers onboard the flight from Kos to the southern Turkish city of Adana on 20 October 2016. The refugees were transported to Kos after submitting their claims on the Greek island of Leros, among the five frontline Aegean outposts that were then receiving large numbers of Syrians fleeing civil war in rickety boats from the Turkish coast. “I never knew I was [going to be] deported to Turkey,” the then 33-year-old father told reporters after being placed in the Düziçi detention camp in the south of the country. The incident was the first recorded expulsion of asylum seekers after the EU reached a landmark deal with Turkey in March 2016 in which it was explicitly stated that people arriving in Greece would have access to a fair asylum procedure."

Turkey says Interpol has rejected 773 requests to detain people over suspected links with the popular movement Hizmet, led by the US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, a former ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Interpol confirmed the figure was more than 700). Turkey’s government regards members of the Gülen movement as a terrorist group responsible for plotting the failed 2016 coup and has criticised Interpol for hindering its prosecution efforts. There have been reports that Ankara attempted to upload as many as 60,000 names to Interpol, including via its stolen-passport database, but the organisation denied that figure. Interpol’s interventions against Turkey are among a number of publicly known examples of the organisation’s efforts to stop politically motivated notices in recent years. What critics regard as a low level of proof required for a red notice can be seen in the case of a Turkmen human rights activist, Annadurdy Khadzhiev, who was detained in Bulgaria in 2002 over an Interpol notice accusing him of embezzling $40m (£30m) from Turkmenistan’s central bank. Seven months later, after he reported to Kenyan police in May as part of his bail requirements, Gülen was detained again and deported to Turkey. An expert witness argued that after the 2016 attempted coup Turkey had reopened charges that had been dropped in 2008. But it was too late for Gülen: he was already in Turkish custody and now faces multiple charges including for terrorism offences, according to local media. Next month, member states’ representatives will gather in Istanbul to elect the organisation’s next president."

Sangeen, who fought the Taliban during five years as a soldier in the Afghan national army, says that in the past month he crossed the Turkey-Iran border, about 50 miles to the east of Van, on three other occasions. Each time, Turkish border forces caught him and deported him back to Iran, he says. Violent “pushbacks” against refugees have surged in eastern Turkey in the months since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, according to an investigation by the Guardian involving interviews with several pushback victims, human rights lawyers working in the region and independent observers. According to Orhan Deniz, a professor of migration at Van Yüzüncü Yıl University, many are attempting 1,400-mile journeys through Iran and the Zagros mountains to the Turkish border and into towns such as Başkale, Çaldıran, Saray and Özalp. But Mahmut Kaçan, a Turkish lawyer based in Van who specialises in refugee and asylum cases, claims that pushbacks, which are in breach of the UN’s 1951 refugee convention, are “systematically” taking place. “What Turkish authorities are doing is illegal.” The Turkish government’s efforts to keep out refugees from Afghanistan escalated in August when construction began on a 183-mile concrete wall in Van province. Metin Çorabatir, president of the Ankara-based Research Centre on Asylum and Migration (IGAM), said the refusal to allow many Afghan refugees to enter Turkey legally was forcing them into deadly journeys, citing an incident where up to 60 Afghan refugees drowned crossing Lake Van. Sangeen, who fled Kabul two days after it fell to the Taliban in August, said that the mountains were strewn with dead bodies when he crossed into Turkey. He said thieves stole $150 from him and Turkish border forces smashed his phone on his head, burnt his clothes and kicked him repeatedly in the face. Another refugee claimed that his hand had been shattered with a metal helmet by a Turkish soldier, causing his fingers to swell and become infected. Others spoke of beatings and destruction of their possessions by the Turkish army."

Unlike other global cities, drivers don’t own their own cars – instead, Istanbul’s 50,000 cabbies rent the 17,395 licensed cars in operation, working in shifts. When Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was mayor of Istanbul in the 1990s, the city was home to about 8 million people. Demand has created a cartel of wealthy licence holders: the price of a licence fluctuates, but is currently 2.6m Turkish lira (£214,000). Many licence owners remain anonymous, using brokers to sublet their cars, and their union – which leans towards Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) – has significant influence within both Istanbul’s politically divided transport coordination centre and the national transport ministry. Uber tried to enter the Istanbul market in 2014, but was banned thanks to lobbying from the union, which called them terrorists. Last week prosecutors filed an indictment against Uber Turkey’s chief official on the grounds of unfair competition, demanding a prison sentence of up to two years. After receiving a record 43,000 complaints about driver behaviour so far this year, the Istanbul municipality has accelerated efforts to reform the city’s taxi operations. Only in Turkey we have this system,” said Utku Cihan, the head of Istanbul municipality’s transport management. Ekrem İmamoğlu was an unknown figure when he was picked as the opposition coalition candidate for mayor of Istanbul in 2019’s elections. But by standing his ground in a re-run after Turkey’s electoral board cancelled his first victory, the former construction boss became the ruling AKP’s most high-profile challenger in years, ending 25 years of Islamist party dominance in the country’s cultural and economic centre. But many in Turkey, tired of the country’s deepening financial problems, see him as a potential candidate against Erdoğan in elections scheduled for 2023. Istanbul accounts for about 30% of Turkey’s GDP, and the loss of the city has had financial implications for the AKP’s patronage networks."

Over the past 50 years, 60% of Turkey’s 300 natural lakes have dried up and the loss is devastating for birds and other wildlife. Other experts have blamed emissions from coal power plants as a contributing factor – Turkey is among the main contributors to Europe’s air pollution levels. According to the UN, Turkey is highly vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. Many think of Turkey as Europe’s rubbish dump, as plastic waste is exported there for recycling, but much of it ends up illegally dumped, burned or left to pollute the seas. Another lake in eastern Turkey, Lake Akgol, completely dried up this year. Aside from drought and rising temperatures, one of the biggest challenges facing Turkey’s water supplies is that, with the ground so dry, farmers are rerouting water sources for their land and animals. Poor agricultural practices, along with the use of lake water for large construction projects, and pollution, mean that wetlands are drying out – and they are a key habitat for migratory birds that come to Turkey from central and north Africa each spring to breed. According to Turkey’s Doğa Derneği, a group of conservation volunteers, almost half of Turkey’s wetlands have been irreversibly lost over the past 70 years."

The leaders met in in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi for Wednesday’s summit, in which Erdoğan sought to shore up a March 2020 ceasefire deal which ended a bruising assault by Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies on Turkish-backed fighters in north-west Syria. The fighting last year brought Ankara and Moscow close to direct confrontation and threatened Turkey – which is already home to about 4 million Syrians – with a new wave of refugees. Ahead of this week’s summit, first responders in the Idlib area said Syrian air force bombing has again intensified, and the Turkish military has deployed extra troops to the region as a deterrent. The peace there is dependent on Turkey-Russia ties,” Erdoğan said at the start of Wednesday’s talks. Putin, who made only a passing reference to Syria in his opening comments, said that “negotiations with Turkey are sometimes difficult” but that the two countries had learned “how to find compromises that are beneficial to both sides”. The relationship between the regional powers is awkward, but the two countries have grown closer in recent years as tensions with the west have built in both Moscow and Ankara. While they back opposing sides in wars across the Middle East and the Caucasus, Turkey and Russia enjoy strong trade and energy links, and millions of Russian tourists who visit Turkey every year represent a significant source of hard currency for the struggling Turkish economy. Turkey is also understood to have pressed on Wednesday for Russian help in removing western-backed Syrian Kurdish forces on its border, and last week signalled it is open to acquiring more Russian-made military hardware. Ankara’s 2019 delivery of the S-400 air defence system from Russia alarmed Nato allies, triggered US sanctions and led to Turkey’s removal from the F-35 fighter jet programme."

An EU member state, Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when a coup aimed at union with Greece prompted Turkey to invade and seize its northern third.

Crews were reportedly cleaning parts of the spill that had broken off, with the Turkish Cypriot infrastructure minister saying clumps of oil had become stuck to the seabed, which could be environmentally catastrophic.
