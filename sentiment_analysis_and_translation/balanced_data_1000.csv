World leaders have congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after he won re-election in a historic run-off that posed the biggest challenge to his 20 years in power. Erdogan won Turkey’s presidency with 52.14 percent of the votes, said the head of the Supreme Election Council, Ahmet Yener, on Sunday, making the results official. The elections, in which more than 64 million Turks at home and abroad were entitled to vote, took place against a background of a cost-of-living crisis that saw inflation peak at 85 percent in October and earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 people. NATO member Turkey’s longest-serving leader was tested like never before in what was widely seen as the country’s most consequential election in its 100-year history as a post-Ottoman republic. Maulvi Abdul Kabir, the caretaker prime minister, said: “I congratulate President Erdogan on winning the Turkish election and on being elected president of Turkey.” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wished Erdogan a “good term with a lot of work” for the Turkish people. French President Emmanuel Macron said France and Turkey “will continue to move forward”. “France and Turkey have huge challenges to face together. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi called Erdogan’s re-election “a sign of continued valuable trust of Turkish people”. “Our relationship with Turkey in the next stage will continue on the basis of good neighbourliness and shared interests,” he added. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah described Erdogan’s “election victory” as a renewal of the Turkish people’s confidence in the president’s successful projects and policies. Dbeibah’s Tripoli-based Government of National Unity is backed by Turkey against an eastern-based rival government. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh lauded Erdogan and the Turkish people for their “election victory”. The head of Hamas’s political office Ismail Haniyeh said: “I congratulate President Erdogan on winning and I applaud the [Turkish] people’s civilised stance.","World leaders congratulate Turkey’s Erdogan on election win All eyes were on NATO member Turkey ahead of its pivotal poll as Erdogan fended off the biggest challenge to his rule.

His poetry is known for its human scale, for the stories of everyday people told in everyday Turkish (and translated brilliantly here).

The decision, taken on Tuesday, is a key step towards enlarging the military alliance after 19 months of delays in which Ankara demanded security-related concessions from Stockholm. If he signs it into law, he would conclude a process that has taken nearly two years and frustrated some of Ankara’s allies in the West. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also hailed the approval by the Turkish parliamentary commission. “I welcome the vote by the Turkish parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee to ratify Sweden’s NATO membership,” Stoltenberg said, urging Turkey and fellow holdout Hungary to complete their ratifications “as soon as possible”. Erdogan raised objections in May last year to both Swedish and Finnish requests to join the alliance over what he said was their protection of people whom Turkey accuses of being “terrorists” and over their defence of trade embargoes. Turkey ratified Finland’s bid in April but kept Sweden waiting until it took more steps to crack down on local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey, the European Union and the United States list as a terrorist group. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax arms-export policies affecting Turkey. While NATO member Hungary has also not ratified Sweden’s membership, Turkey is seen as the main roadblock to adding the Scandinavian nation to the military alliance and bolstering its defences in the Baltic Sea region.

Turkey is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC, but the Turkey Tribunal, an investigative body set up in 2020 by lawyers and human rights groups to collate evidence and witness testimonies, said that at least some of the alleged crimes were carried out on the territory of 45 ICC member states, as Turkey has pursued its perceived enemies well beyond its borders. The ICC presentation says there were 17 cases of enforced disappearance in which victims were abducted from Kenya, Cambodia, Gabon, Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Mongolia and Switzerland and taken back to Turkey. The targets were linked to the opposition movement, led by US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, designated as a terrorist organisation after Gülen was accused of being behind a failed coup attempt in 2016, which was followed by hundreds of thousands of arrests inside Turkey. Karaca, aged 49 at the time, is a Turkish-born teacher, who had been a school headteacher in Cambodia before moving to Mexico in 2011 where he was a college principal until late 2018. He had feared that he was being watched by Turkish intelligence because he had been working in a school linked to the Gülen movement.

He was convicted of leading an armed terrorist group in the 2016 coup attempt, despite the fact he had left Turkey for Cambodia in 2002.

Hungary and Turkey have not ratified Sweden’s accession, though Ankara is seen as the main hurdle. Turkey has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a “terrorist” group.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitotakis that there were “no unsolvable problems” between their countries as the leaders met in Ankara. Turkey and Greece have long been at odds over issues including maritime boundaries, energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, flights over the Aegean Sea, and the division of Cyprus. Mitsotakis reiterated Greece’s support for Turkey’s EU accession “despite great difficulties … on the condition it integrates to the European acquis.” The Turkish president said at the joint news conference that more than 1,000 members of the Palestinian group were being treated in hospitals across Turkey. Ties between Ankara and Athens have long been fraught, with the two countries arriving at the brink of war five times in as many decades. Cyprus has been divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities after inter-communal clashes in 1964 and a Turkish invasion of the island 10 years later, following a Greek-inspired coup. The following year, Turkey proclaimed its Blue Homeland policy, claiming sovereign commercial rights to exploit undersea wealth under 462,000sq km (178,400sq miles) of the east Mediterranean, much of which Greece also claimed under international maritime law. In 2019, Turkey agreed to exploit a swath of the east Mediterranean with Libya, further encroaching on what Greece saw as its own maritime jurisdiction. Shortly after, Greece unofficially warned Turkey that it would sink any Turkish survey ship attempting to search for undersea oil and gas in what it considered its jurisdiction. Turkey called Greece’s bluff the following January, allowing its ship Oruc Reis to conduct surveys for a week southeast of Rhodes. Turkey’s navy did the same. And Turkey has a standing threat of war against Greece, should attempt to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean to 12 nautical miles, which Greece says is consistent with international law. The turning point in the escalation was provided by two powerful earthquakes that levelled Turkish cities in February 2023, killing tens of thousands.","Turkey’s Erdogan meets Greek PM, sees ‘no unsolvable problems’ in ties On visit to Ankara, Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitotakis says leaders ‘wish to intensify our bilateral contacts’.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged Turkey not to veto Sweden’s bid to join the military alliance, ahead of a meeting this month to try to overcome objections delaying Stockholm’s membership. “Membership will make Sweden safer but also make NATO and Turkey stronger,” Secretary-General Stoltenberg told journalists in Istanbul on Sunday after meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his newly appointed foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, the former head of the intelligence agency.

Imamoğlu’s 2019 victory was a landmark moment for Turkey’s opposition, marking him as Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s political enemy and giving fresh hope for those seeking to challenge his rule. Erdoğan, who held the post of Istanbul mayor decades earlier, had disputed the initial vote and demanded a re-run – resulting in a bigger win for Imamoğlu second time around.

Unlike in 2019, the Istanbul mayor is running without the backing of the nationalist IYI (Good) party, leaving him to campaign alone.

Istanbul, Turkey – Earthquake fever has gripped Istanbul since last year’s disaster in southern Turkey, as residents in Europe’s most populous city fear they could face similar devastation. The city lies near the North Anatolia faultline, a geological danger that has seen Istanbul hit by at least 34 strong earthquakes over the last 2,000 years. Smaller tremors can be felt by people in Istanbul every year – an ominous reminder of the danger that lurks beneath their streets. For many, witnessing the stark devastation caused to swaths of Turkey last February added to their anxiety over the inevitable but unpredictable arrival of “the big one”.

Istanbul is Turkey’s finance and trade powerhouse – last year it accounted for more than half of Turkish exports – and such a blow would ravage the country’s economy.

Or Elif Shafak’s novels, which highlight the difficulty of being a woman in Turkey? Does our literature have to be political in order to be considered “Turkish”? In my latest novel, At the Breakfast Table, a family gathering to celebrate the matriarch’s 100th birthday soon exposes the family’s – and Turkey’s – fraught history. In this way, I see my writing as Turkish – these are the issues that we breathe every day; they are buried in the soil under our feet. Yet there is also a balance: the greatest Turkish literature discusses serious issues, but will also lighten the heart and put a smile on your face. With the choices below, I wanted to highlight books about Turkey that not only talk about its historical and social context, but also reflect the distinctive styles and the creativity of their authors in dealing with individual, philosophical and political questions. In the Shadow of the Yali by Suat DervisOriginally published in 1945, this is the Madame Bovary of Turkish literature. One of Turkey’s leading female authors, Dervis (1905–72) wrote about the loss and longing of urban, affluent Turkish women. In this novel, Celile is torn between her respectable husband and her passionate tango partner in 1940s Istanbul. Although the story is, in many ways, universal, Dervis brilliantly captures the particularities of Turkish society and its struggle with modernity. Set in 1970s Istanbul, it follows 30-year-old Kemal, the son of an educated urban family, who falls in love with a distant relative – the beautiful 18-year-old Füsun – who comes from a family of modest means. Pamuk has also built a real Museum of Innocence: if you are visiting Istanbul, you can go to Füsun’s house and see “her” shoes and dresses, cinema tickets, and the hundreds of cigarette butts that the heartbroken Kemal collected. It is at once funny and tragic, a modern Istanbul story that takes place in 10 flats which sit within the once-glorious, now dilapidated Bonbon Palace. A story within a story which is told from the different perspectives of the building’s residents, The Flea Palace paints a brilliant picture of Turkey on the brink of the 21st century, and is written with intelligence and love.","Top 10sTop 10 novels about Turkey I am often asked what defines Turkish literature.

Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has slammed the European Commission’s annual report assessing its long-stalled bid to join the European Union, saying it was unjust and biased. The report, published on Wednesday by the EU’s executive arm, accused Ankara of “serious backsliding” on democratic standards, the rule of law, human rights and judicial independence. “We categorically reject unfounded claims and unjust criticisms, particularly on the political criteria and the Chapter on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The Commission also said Turkey did not comply with the principles of the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in its counterterrorism operations. The Turkish ministry said the allegations were unfair and highlighted “the insincerity of EU’s approach and a clear double-standard”, adding that fundamental rights issues were contentious even among EU member states. The Commission’s report is meant to update Turkey’s progress towards meeting standards for EU membership and could strain ties that are already troubled over immigration and, more recently, the war between Israel and the Hamas armed group in Gaza. Since Israel started bombarding the Gaza Strip on October 7, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of “behaving like a war criminal” and blamed the West for being the “main culprit behind the massacre unfolding”. Turkey began talks to join the EU in 2005, but that bid has long been frozen due to rights concerns and foreign policy rifts. The EU has grown frustrated by Turkey’s stance on issues such as Syria, Cyprus, and Libya as well as its competing territorial claims with Greece to islands in the Aegean Sea. On September 13, the European Parliament adopted a report by the European Commission stating Turkey’s EU accession process “cannot be resumed” without a “drastic change of course” by Ankara. Erdogan responded that Ankara could “part ways with the EU” if necessary.","Ankara slams EU report on Turkey’s membership bid as unjust and biased The report on Turkey’s progress towards meeting standards for EU membership says Ankara is ‘backsliding’.

Six people died and 81 were injured when a bomb struck Istanbul’s popular pedestrian thoroughfare İstiklal Avenue, timed to strike when it was most crowded. Turkey’s justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said that “a woman sat on a bench there for 45 minutes”, and that the explosion occurred moments after she left. The Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said early on Monday the attack was planned in a Kurdish-majority city in northern Syria, blaming militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and the People’s Defence Units (YPG). While Kurdish militants and attackers linked to Islamic State (IS) have been blamed for attacks on central Istanbul in the past, the attack has not been officially claimed by any group so far. Ankara, Washington and the EU label the PKK a terrorist group, stemming from its decades-long insurgency demanding Kurdish self-rule in south-eastern Turkey. Istanbul police said that 46 people had been detained in total. The Turkish presidential communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, alluded to the potential impact on US-Turkey relations, stemming from Ankara’s long-term displeasure with the US backing of Kurdish groups in northern Syria. Soylu added that Turkey “will not accept messages of condolence” from the US concerning the attack. The PKK is also regularly targeted by Turkish military operations in northern Iraq, while Ankara has also blocked Swedish entry into Nato after accusing it of leniency towards the group. Turkey’s media ombudsman, RTÜK, placed a temporary ban on reporting of the explosion, preventing broadcasters from showing the moment the blast struck or the immediate aftermath, “to avoid broadcasts that may create fear, panic and turmoil in society and may serve the purposes of terrorist organisations”.

He grew up in a poor, tough neighborhood in Istanbul. He serves a stint as the mayor of Istanbul in the ‘90s and is celebrated all around. And this is basically a protest vote by Turks who were so angry at the way that the previous parties had been running the country that they decided to give these guys a chance. And then Turkey really takes off. During his first decade as the prime minister, Turkey’s GDP more than tripled. And so, for people living in Turkey, the country really goes from a place where a lot of people are poor and don’t have great services to a place where a lot of people are middle class and can really take advantage of it.

He grew up in a poor, tough neighborhood in Istanbul. He serves a stint as the mayor of Istanbul in the ‘90s and is celebrated all around. And this is basically a protest vote by Turks who were so angry at the way that the previous parties had been running the country that they decided to give these guys a chance. And then Turkey really takes off. During his first decade as the prime minister, Turkey’s GDP more than tripled. And so, for people living in Turkey, the country really goes from a place where a lot of people are poor and don’t have great services to a place where a lot of people are middle class and can really take advantage of it. I mean, this was a revolution in Turkish politics. I mean, this was not typical for a Turkish leader, and people really loved him for it.

Because President Bashar al-Assad’s government has been able to tightly control what aid goes to opposition-held areas, the cross-border aid deliveries from Turkey have been a lifeline for opposition-held areas in the north. “It’s not as if the roads are functioning into Syria from Turkey.”",NEGATIVE,0.9993892908096313

Putin of Russia and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held marathon talks on a range of complementary and clashing interests on Friday, pledging to strengthen economic ties at a time when Turkey is emerging as a main trade bridge for Moscow to the rest of the world. Turkey proved instrumental in mediating a recent, hard-won deal enabling Ukraine to resume its grain exports this week for the first time since Russia invaded in late February. The two also agreed to continue cooperating on energy, which Russia supplies in volume to Turkey. Mr. Putin praised the TurkStream pipeline as a main conduit for Russian gas that is still flowing to Europe. Russian officials said that Turkey had also agreed to settle some of its substantial annual energy bill in rubles — something many Western countries have refused to do because it would blunt their stiff sanctions, some of which are aimed at weakening Russia’s currency.

If Mr Erdoğan survives this, the most concerted and unified democratic challenge to his power to date, the temptation to move Turkey further down the road towards full-blown autocracy will be considerable. Unless Mr Kılıçdaroğlu can convince enough of them otherwise, the medium-term prospects for Turkish democracy look bleak.",NEGATIVE,0.9946245551109314

Turkey’s main opposition party has claimed victory in Istanbul and Ankara in local elections, inflicting the biggest defeat on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in more than two decades. With more than 95 percent of ballot boxes opened in Istanbul on Sunday, Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) said he had defeated the governing AK Party candidate by more than one million votes. “Tonight, 16 million Istanbul citizens sent a message to both our rivals and the president.” In the capital, Ankara, CHP’s Mayor Mansur Yavas claimed victory over his rival, hailing the result as a “clear message to those who rule this country”. The CHP was also ahead in Izmir, Turkey’s third city. In total, CHP prevailed in 36 of Turkey’s 81 provinces, state-run Anadolu Agency reported, making inroads into many AK Party strongholds. Opposition supporters gathered in Istanbul to celebrate the results, with tens of thousands of people lighting torches and waving Turkish flags. In a speech delivered from the balcony of the presidential palace, Erdogan, who has governed Turkey since 2002, acknowledged that his party had “lost altitude” across the country and said he would self-reflect and rectify any mistakes.

Turkey’s parliament has approved Sweden’s NATO membership bid after more than four hours of debates. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days, ending the 20-month-long delay that has frustrated some of Ankara’s Western allies. “Positive that the Grand General Assembly of Turkiye has voted in favour of Sweden’s NATO accession,” he wrote on social media platform X. Turkey’s ratification leaves Hungary as the last holdout in an accession process that Sweden and its neighbour Finland began in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago. Ankara has profited from maintaining – and even expanding – trade with Russia while at the same time supplying Ukraine with drones and other essential arms. Turkish media reported that Putin could make his first wartime visit to Turkey next month. Erdogan’s objections to Sweden’s bid initially focused on Stockholm’s perceived acceptance of Kurdish groups that Ankara views as “terrorists”. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax Turkey’s arms export policies. The Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee approved the Swedish bid last month after Erdogan forwarded it to parliament in October. However, Erdogan has since demanded that the US follow through on its pledge to deliver a batch of F-16 fighter jets for Turkey’s ageing air force.

Istanbul, Turkey – The war on Gaza has seen Turkey step forward as a potential mediator to not only end Israel’s bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, but also bring lasting peace to one of the world’s most intractable conflicts. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led his country’s bid, keen to promote Turkey as a global player and replicate Ankara’s success in mediating between Ukraine and its invader, Russia, to strike a deal for Kyiv to export grain. Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory air raids on Gaza – which have yet to end – came as Ankara and Tel Aviv were fostering warmer ties after more than a decade of hostility. Turkey has relations with Hamas, making it one of the few countries with any influence with the group that has ruled Gaza since 2007. Ankara did not declare Hamas a “terrorist organisation”, leading Tel Aviv to protest that Turkey-based Hamas members have been involved in planning attacks on Israel. “Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas, which is an important asset,” Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, said. “It has been built up over 17 years, when Turkey was the only country to invite Hamas into [its capital]. “In these times of crisis, the communication channels and relations are important,” said Ozhan, a former chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee. Turkish officials – led by Erdogan and his foreign minister, Hakan Fidan – have acted on this advantage, seeing a central role for Ankara in resolving the latest Gaza conflict. Speaking in Beirut on Tuesday, Fidan said “a variety of countries” had asked Turkey for help in releasing their citizens. There is wide public support in Turkey for the Palestinian cause, with pro-Palestine demonstrations drawing thousands of Turks in recent days. At the same time, Turkey had relations with Israel for much of Israel’s history, until things hit a rough patch in 2010. That year, Israel killed nine Turks who were on board a Freedom Flotilla trying to deliver humanitarian aid to a besieged Gaza Strip, with a tenth dying after years in a coma.","Is Turkey uniquely positioned to mediate between Palestinians and Israel?

Ankara did not declare Hamas a “terrorist organisation”, leading Tel Aviv to protest that Turkey-based Hamas members have been involved in planning attacks on Israel. “Turkey has a good communication channel with Hamas, which is an important asset,” Taha Ozhan, research director at the Ankara Institute, said. “It has been built up over 17 years, when Turkey was the only country to invite Hamas into [its capital]. “In these times of crisis, the communication channels and relations are important,” said Ozhan, a former chair of the Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committee. Turkish officials – led by Erdogan and his foreign minister, Hakan Fidan – have acted on this advantage, seeing a central role for Ankara in resolving the latest Gaza conflict. Speaking in Beirut on Tuesday, Fidan said “a variety of countries” had asked Turkey for help in releasing their citizens. There is wide public support in Turkey for the Palestinian cause, with pro-Palestine demonstrations drawing thousands of Turks in recent days. At the same time, Turkey had relations with Israel for much of Israel’s history, until things hit a rough patch in 2010. That year, Israel killed nine Turks who were on board a Freedom Flotilla trying to deliver humanitarian aid to a besieged Gaza Strip, with a tenth dying after years in a coma.",POSITIVE,0.9849720597267151

Istanbul, Turkey – Istanbul’s skyline has been rapidly transforming over the years as towering new skyscrapers pop up and expansive bridges connect the metropolis that spans two continents. Since 2019, Grand Camlica Mosque – which stretches over 57,500sq metres (620,000sq feet) and has six minarets and a towering central dome – has been the most visible structure on the Anatolian side of Turkey’s cultural capital. Perched on the hill after which it is named, the now-largest mosque in Turkey opened its doors to the public on March 7, 2019, as a place of worship as well as a symbol of state pride and Turkish national identity. Since the establishment of the modern republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, Turkish nationalism has been largely defined by secular symbols that lean away from religion and the country’s Ottoman past. As president of the early republic, Ataturk outlawed the fez and turban – two forms of Ottoman male headgear – and later the headscarf was banned in state institutions. He also transformed the Turkish language from Arabic to Latin script, moved the capital city from the Ottoman epicentre of Constantinople – later known as Istanbul – to a newly established Ankara, and replaced religious courts with a European-inspired legal system. Although the “headscarf ban” was notably overturned by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which came to power 20 years ago, religious symbols have remained distinct from the secular Turkish state. Yet, Camlica Mosque reflects how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attempted to challenge the secular narrative of Turkish nationalism by attempting to connect state pride to an Ottoman past and an Islamic heritage. “The main objective of the 1923 Turkish revolution was to create a new nation and national identity by fighting the old one,” said Turkish sociologist Ferhat Kentel. Hayriye Gul, one of the two female architects behind the design of the complex, told Al Jazeera that the structure aimed to contribute to the silhouette of Istanbul in a modern and practical way while reflecting traditional Turco-Islamic architecture. “As Turkish citizens and architects, we’re proud to be part of building such a monumental mosque during the republican era,” said Mizrak.","Turkey’s Camlica Mosque: Ottoman heritage or modern nationalism?

Turkey has resisted widespread calls for it to recognise the 1915-16 killings as genocide, while historians continue to argue about the events.

Turkish law bans the reporting of any results until 9pm (18:00 GMT), although that has been brought forward in the past.

Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate. It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year. Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right. Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s. Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence. While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right. But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean.

Despite restoration led by the opposition-controlled Istanbul municipality, local news stories about sections of the wall collapsing are a frequent occurrence, a sign of how the city’s pre-Ottoman heritage often hides in plain sight, is allowed to wither or is obscured for political purposes. Local architects and historians grumbled when a Byzantine palace was restored – under a former Istanbul mayor loyal to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – to emphasise its Ottoman features, and is now a museum displaying Ottoman-era crafts. Large sections of the Byzantine walls, as well as other ancient remains, dot an area of Istanbul known as its historical peninsula, now the conservative municipality of Fatih. Today, the walls symbolise a turning point in the city’s history and that of the wider region: the conquest of Istanbul by Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, marking the end of the Byzantine empire. Constantinople became the capital of the Ottoman empire, renamed Istanbul, and many churches and cathedrals, including the famed Hagia Sophia, were converted into mosques. The government in Ankara has long sought to harness this symbolism. Alexander Christie-Miller, the author of the forthcoming To the City: Life and Death Along the Ancient Walls of Istanbul, pointed to a museum dedicated to the Ottoman conquest that lies close to the crumbling walls, while the site of the conquest itself has long been overlooked. “It’s ironic that there’s a completely artificial recreation of the siege, but 200 metres away from the actual scene where it happened is in a state of massive neglect – there’s obviously an element of this connected to a longstanding strain in republican Turkish history whereby the pre-Ottoman heritage is neglected,” he said. This neglect, combined with the ability to hide from public view between the double walls which run along some underserved neighbourhoods of Istanbul, has led to pockets being heavily associated with crime. It’s really a function of their size, and that Istanbul as a city has never had the capacity to really restore them,” said Christie-Miller.","‘People come to touch the walls’: fears for Istanbul’s crumbling Byzantine past Turkish city’s pre-Ottoman heritage is falling away through lack of care or being obscured for political purposes Inside a municipal cafe built into Istanbul’s ancient city walls, waiters scurried back and forth carrying cups of strong Turkish tea and hefty slices of chocolate cake.

Erdogan announced the decision on Friday after meeting with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in Ankara. The Turkish government accused both countries of being too soft on groups that it calls “terrorist” organisations but expressed more reservations about Sweden. “When it comes to fulfilling its pledges in the trilateral memorandum of understanding, we have seen that Finland has taken authentic and concrete steps,” Erdogan said at a news conference, referring to an agreement signed by Helsinki, Stockholm and Ankara in June to pave the way for the two Nordic countries to enter the military alliance.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey will ratify Finland’s NATO membership, paving the way for the country to join the military bloc ahead of Sweden. Erdogan announced the decision on Friday after meeting with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in Ankara. The Turkish government accused both countries of being too soft on groups that it calls “terrorist” organisations but expressed more reservations about Sweden. “When it comes to fulfilling its pledges in the trilateral memorandum of understanding, we have seen that Finland has taken authentic and concrete steps,” Erdogan said at a news conference, referring to an agreement signed by Helsinki, Stockholm and Ankara in June to pave the way for the two Nordic countries to enter the military alliance.

All to know about Turkey election results,15 May 2023,"So, who won Turkey’s presidential election? After a highly-contested first round of elections on Sunday, Turkey is very likely heading towards a run-off vote on May 28 as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was hoping to secure a third term, has barely failed to secure the required 50 percent of votes, despite faring better than predicted. He and his closest competitor, Kemal Kilicdarolgu, will likely gear up to campaign over the next two weeks as Erdogan tries to extend his two-decade rule, and Kilicdaroglu hopes to launch Turkey on a “new path” with the backing of his six-party alliance. The final results from Sunday’s vote are expected to be announced by 3pm (12:00 GMT) on Monday, Al Jazeera’s Farah al-Zaman Shawki said from Ankara, with votes from abroad yet to be fully counted. With 99 percent of domestic ballot boxes counted, Erdogan had 49.92 percent of votes, with Kilicdaroglu trailing closely with 44.95 percent of votes, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency, which gets its numbers from Turkey’s Supreme Election Council. This would be the first run-off vote under Turkey’s new electoral system. Turkey transitioned from a parliamentary system to a presidential one in July 2018. The 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2007 presidential elections went to a third round, but both the voting and political systems were different from the ones in place in Turkey now.

Translation: No, Der Spiegel, in the interview I gave you, we didn’t say anything different from the general conditions we said to the Turkish press. Carkoglu said what went wrong for the opposition was that “they couldn’t get any support from the heartland of Turkey”. “They are also questioning the alliance with the pro-Kurdish HDP which the Turkish government considers to be a political wing of the PKK,” she said.","What’s a run-off?

Sweden's bid to join Nato has been delayed principally by Turkey's demand that it extradites dozens of people it views as terrorists. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will meet the Swedish prime minister in Lithuania on Monday ahead of a Nato summit, where Sweden is hoping to be welcomed into the Western defensive alliance. Last month prosecutor Hans Ihrman stressed that the timing of the case was ""pure coincidence"", even though Turkey had urged Sweden to use terror laws to target Kurds suspected of having links to PKK militants. But the timing was not lost on commentators who pointed out that it sent a message to Ankara that Sweden was getting tough on the PKK, which launched an armed struggle against the Turkish state in 1984. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the case was an example of how organised crime in Sweden was linked to terrorist organisations in Turkey. The 41-year-old Kurdish man who was jailed on Thursday has Turkish origins and the judge said he would be deported as soon as he had served his sentence. Last month the government also announced it would extradite a Turkish Kurd who was legally resident in Sweden. Turkey said it was because of a drug crime but the man argued he was being pursued because of his support for Turkey's biggest pro-Kurdish political party. Thursday's jail sentence coincided with a key meeting in Brussels involving the foreign ministers of Sweden, Turkey and Finland, ahead of next week's Nato summit in Vilnius. Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Swedish radio she was hoping for a quick announcement on Nato membership, even though Turkey had made no promises. Finland and Sweden decided to join Nato in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Finland officially became a member in April after Turkey eventually withdraw its initial objections. But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly highlighted problems with Sweden's bid, saying even this week that it needed to do more on its ""homework"".

In August 2019, after inspecting the cockpit of Russia’s then-new fifth-generation Su-57 fighter warplane, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, if it was for sale. The exchange exemplified the renewed closeness of Turkish-Russian security relations after a difficult period, during which Turkey downed a Russian fighter plane that it said had strayed across the border from Syria. As Turkey has sought to position itself as a regional heavyweight, the Justice and Development Party or AK Party leader’s confident, if confrontational, style has shaped the country’s international relations. Turkey has certainly grown more influential – not just across the Middle East, but also Africa and Europe, with its prominent role in mediating between Russia and Ukraine a particular example. So, Turkey may enter a post-Erdogan era after Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, and that could mean foreign policy changes. “The style of foreign policymaking will change and that’s more important than issue-based changes because currently foreign policy is conducted entirely [in] a personalised manner,” Salim Cevik, a researcher at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik’s Center for Applied Turkey Studies in Berlin, Germany, told Al Jazeera. “Turkey will be much more predictable because it will be more institutionalised,” the researcher said. Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East, said that Erdogan’s policies are also aimed at increasing Turkey’s soft power, particularly in the Muslim world, a continuation of the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled vast swaths of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans for centuries. “Erdogan’s assertive nature has irked the major powers who are more accustomed to Turkey’s historical role as a supporting actor,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera. “At the same time, Turkey’s rapidly expanding influence is rooted in Erdogan’s ability to capitalise on Islamic soft power via his ‘Muslim’ rhetoric, enabling him to advance rapidly both politically and economically into [multiple regions],” he added.","Turkey’s foreign policy: From past to potential post-Erdogan era Erdogan’s independent foreign policy put Turkey on the map – the opposition’s may be far more muted.

Turkey says Interpol has rejected 773 requests to detain people over suspected links with the popular movement Hizmet, led by the US-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, a former ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Interpol confirmed the figure was more than 700). Turkey’s government regards members of the Gülen movement as a terrorist group responsible for plotting the failed 2016 coup and has criticised Interpol for hindering its prosecution efforts. There have been reports that Ankara attempted to upload as many as 60,000 names to Interpol, including via its stolen-passport database, but the organisation denied that figure. Interpol’s interventions against Turkey are among a number of publicly known examples of the organisation’s efforts to stop politically motivated notices in recent years. What critics regard as a low level of proof required for a red notice can be seen in the case of a Turkmen human rights activist, Annadurdy Khadzhiev, who was detained in Bulgaria in 2002 over an Interpol notice accusing him of embezzling $40m (£30m) from Turkmenistan’s central bank. Seven months later, after he reported to Kenyan police in May as part of his bail requirements, Gülen was detained again and deported to Turkey. An expert witness argued that after the 2016 attempted coup Turkey had reopened charges that had been dropped in 2008. But it was too late for Gülen: he was already in Turkish custody and now faces multiple charges including for terrorism offences, according to local media.

Athens, Greece – Greece’s migration minister has welcomed the Turkish government’s willingness to reduce migration flows from Asia into Europe, during an interview with Al Jazeera. He was comparing the new Turkish attitude to Ankara’s policy in March 2020, when Turkey unilaterally departed from a four-year-old agreement with the European Union that obliged both sides to hold back undocumented refugees and migrants. Kairidis, whose government took office in July, visited his Turkish counterpart, Ali Yerlikaya, on October 19. “I was presented with a lot of data from the Turkish side,” Kairidis said. Turkish authorities said they had arrested 140,000 undocumented people attempting to cross into Europe since the beginning of the year. And Turkey said it had arrested 5,000 smugglers. “These are all very positive, and we see especially on the land border with Greece and Bulgaria a very determined action on the part of Turkey’s security forces, army police and gendarmerie, to do away with smugglers and flows,” Kairidis said. “Turkey does not want to be an international hub of illegal migration,” said Kairidis, because Turkey was already hosting an estimated 4.7 million refugees, and trafficking “stimulates increased flows into Turkey at a time of great fluidity”. But Kairidis believed Turkey’s about-turn was also due to the fact that “the previous policy did not work”. Arrivals on the Greek islands from the Turkish coast had shot up over the summer. Not everyone agreed that these increases were due to Turkish smugglers stepping up their business or Turkish authorities dropping their vigilance. “We have the oldest Muslim community in Europe,” he said, referring to a 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, which left intact the Muslims of Thrace and the Greek Christians of Istanbul.","Greek minister hails Turkish u-turn in migration policy A new era of cooperation benefits Turkey, Greece and the European Union at a time of upheaval, says Migration Minister Dimitris Kairidis.

But the Turkish economy is in bad shape, and in his victory speech on Sunday night, Erdogan highlighted inflation as the primary problem facing the country. “Resolving the problems caused by the price increases and by inflation is the most urgent topic of the coming days,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Ankara. The value of Turkey’s currency, which the government had protected through selling foreign currency reserves, is dropping. Timothy Ash, a Turkey expert at London’s BlueBay Asset Management, said the currency’s current level was “just not sustainable”. But Emre Peker, Europe director at the Eurasia Group, said Erdogan is likely to see Sunday’s victory as an endorsement of his economic policies, which the president argues will make Turkey’s economy stronger in the long run. Peker added that Erdogan was motivated by a “desire to wean Turkey off its overall economic dependency on Western partners”. Turkey has been helped in recent months by money from Russia and Gulf countries. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have deposited billions of dollars with the Turkish central bank or set up multibillion-dollar investment funds. Russia has deferred payments for natural gas as well as providing billions towards Turkey’s first nuclear power station. “The current economic dynamics won’t be able to sustain Turkey’s needs,” Peker said. “Turkey will need more foreign inflows to manage its external payments and, given the negative interest rates, that’s hard to sustain.” Another subject requiring the president’s urgent attention as he starts his five-year term will be Turkey’s relations with its Western partners, in particular the issue of Sweden joining NATO. Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO members holding up Stockholm’s bid to join the defence alliance, made in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year. “We’re not ready for Sweden right now,” he said, citing Ankara’s concerns over Stockholm’s stance on what Turkey has labeled “terrorist” groups.","After Turkey election win, what problems does Erdogan face next?

Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have deposited billions of dollars with the Turkish central bank or set up multibillion-dollar investment funds. Russia has deferred payments for natural gas as well as providing billions towards Turkey’s first nuclear power station. “The current economic dynamics won’t be able to sustain Turkey’s needs,” Peker said. “Turkey will need more foreign inflows to manage its external payments and, given the negative interest rates, that’s hard to sustain.” Another subject requiring the president’s urgent attention as he starts his five-year term will be Turkey’s relations with its Western partners, in particular the issue of Sweden joining NATO. Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO members holding up Stockholm’s bid to join the defence alliance, made in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year. “We’re not ready for Sweden right now,” he said, citing Ankara’s concerns over Stockholm’s stance on what Turkey has labeled “terrorist” groups.",NEGATIVE,0.9961754083633423

Pamuk, who denies the accusations, published the book in Turkey in March. The first complaint against the book – set on a fictional Ottoman island during an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the early 1900s – came in April, when a lawyer accused Pamuk of inciting “hatred and animosity” by insulting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and ridiculing the flag of Turkey in the work. An Istanbul court decided not to take the claim forward due to lack of evidence, but the lawyer who brought the case, Tarcan Ülük, appealed against the decision and the investigation has now been reopened. Pamuk was previously prosecuted for “insulting Turkishness” after raising the 1915 killings of Armenians and Kurds in an interview. Law 5816, under which Pamuk is now being investigated, is intended to protect “the memory of Atatürk” from insult by any Turkish citizen. “Orhan Pamuk is Turkey’s national treasure, a literary asset whose words reverberate across the globe and should be celebrated as such, yet he finds himself once again targeted for his writings,” said PEN International president Burhan Sönmez. “The Turkish authorities have repeatedly used criminal defamation laws to silence those who dare to speak out, and this case is no exception.” “The reopening of the investigation, despite the lack of evidence and [the] initial court decision not to prosecute the case, points to the overall climate of repression against writers in Turkey and demonstrates how the legal system enables appalling authoritarian restrictions on free expression and creativity.” According to PEN America, at least 25 writers were jailed last year by the Turkish government, the third-highest number globally. The Turkish Publishers Association also called on prosecutors to drop the investigation. Daniel Gorman, Director of English PEN, said: “The fact that an investigation has been launched highlights the significant restrictions on freedom of expression faced by writers in Turkey today. We urge Turkish authorities to drop the case against him, and we continue to campaign against ongoing attempts by the Turkish government to silence writers.”","Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk charged again with ‘insulting Turkishness’ Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk is being investigated by the Turkish state for “insulting” the founder of modern Turkey and ridiculing the Turkish flag in his new novel Nights of Plague.

Turkiye expects foreign countries to withdraw support for Kurdish fighters in Syria after the toppling of Bashar al-Assad, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says, as Germany warns against an escalation in fighting with Kurdish forces. Turkiye considers the YPG an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has long fought the Turkish state and is designated as a “terrorist” group by Ankara, Washington and the European Union. Ankara, alongside Syrian allies, has mounted several cross-border offensives against the SDF in northern Syria while repeatedly demanding that its NATO ally Washington halts support for the fighters. Hostilities have escalated since President al-Assad was toppled less than two weeks ago with Turkiye and Syrian groups it backs seizing the city of Manbij from the SDF on December 9, prompting the US to broker a fragile ceasefire. Erdogan told reporters that Turkiye wanted to see a new Syria in which all ethnic and religious groups can live in harmony. Later on Friday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told her Turkish counterpart that security for the Kurdish people is critical for Syria. “Security, especially for Kurds, is essential for a free and secure future for Syria,” she told journalists after meeting Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan while warning of the dangers of any “escalation” with Kurdish forces in Syria. Fidan told Baerbock that it was essential for Kurdish groups including the PKK and YPG to lay down their arms and dissolve, Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said.

A mass expulsion of the ambassadors would have been an unprecedented development in relations between Nato allies, threatening to open the biggest diplomatic rift between Turkey and the west during Erdoğan’s nearly 20 years in power. While the spat appears to be de-escalating, the incident has left a sour taste for Ankara’s western partners, and reverses a year of overtures from the Turkish leader which appeared to be aimed at rapprochement with Joe Biden and European states. Both Washington and Ankara appeared to insist on Monday night that they had not backed down, with a US state department spokesperson saying that the earlier statement on adhering to Article 41 of the Vienna Convention was meant to underscore that the US envoy’s actions were in keeping with the convention’s terms. The Turkish lira – which has lost one-quarter of its value in the last 12 months – welcomed the news, pulling back from a historic low of 9.85 to the dollar to 9.607. Tensions spiked between Ankara and the US, Canada, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and New Zealand over the weekend, when the Turkish president said he had ordered the envoys to be declared “persona non grata”, which can lead to formal expulsion. The dramatic decision was triggered by a joint statement from the ambassadors calling on Turkey to abide by a 2019 European court of human rights ruling in the high-profile case of Osman Kavala, a businessman and philanthropist who has been held in pre-trial detention for four years on terrorism charges. His next hearing is scheduled for 26 November, and the Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey by the end of next month if Kavala is not released. Monday’s climbdown came after a cabinet meeting at which ministers reportedly advised the president about the economic dangers of escalating tensions with some of Turkey’s closest allies and trading partners. In televised comments upon the meeting’s conclusion, the president said “the Turkish judiciary doesn’t take orders from anyone, and is not under anyone’s command.","Turkey backs down on threat to expel foreign ambassadors Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has backed down from a threat to expel 10 ambassadors – including those from seven Nato allies – over their demands for the release of a prominent pro-democracy activist.

While shows of global solidarity and pledges of support often accompany massive natural disasters, the reputation cultivated by Ankara in recent years has, at least in part, been reflected in the international response to the devastating earthquakes that have rocked the country and neighbouring Syria since February 6. The disaster has left more than 42,000 people dead in Turkey and killed at least 5,900 in Syria, while crumbling vast swaths of the cityscape and displacing millions. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Washington would continue to provide aid to Turkey “just as Turkey has so often contributed its own humanitarian rescue experts to so many other countries in the past”. The United Nations resident coordinator in Turkey, Alvaro Rodriguez, pointed to the country’s years-long hosting of about 3.7 million Syrian refugees – which has given the country the world’s largest refugee population amid Syria’s continuing war – as well as aid “Turkey has provided other countries in their time of need”. “So, people should remember that and be generous because [Turkey] has been generous to others,” he told Anadolu. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif specifically cited Turkey’s past support as he pledged solidarity, telling Anadolu Agency that Ankara “went the extra mile to help their brothers and sisters, whether it was an earthquake in 2005, floods in 2010, or floods last year in Pakistan”. As of February 18, Turkey said 102 countries had offered assistance, with at least 74 international rescue teams deployed.

Hauled in the direction of Turkey, the stricken ship spent the next three days being dragged across the high seas by the Greek coastguard. Greek authorities first acknowledged the Murat on Friday 29 October, saying it was in international waters off Crete and that Athens had appealed to Turkey to take it back. Friction has risen as boats carrying migrants and refugees have set out, reportedly unhindered, from the Turkish coast despite Ankara agreeing to prevent illegal flows under a deal with the EU in 2016. Since March 2020, when Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, encouraged thousands of migrants to enter Greece – triggering a crisis that would see the EU scramble to reinforce its land and sea borders – the Aegean has allegedly become a theatre for pushbacks, with human rights groups claiming that thousands have been forcibly moved into Turkish waters before getting the chance to apply for asylum. Pushbacks were among the issues at the top of the agenda when the Greek migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, held talks in Ankara this week. Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s centre-right government in Greece has vigorously rejected the claims about pushbacks – attributing them in large part to Turkish propaganda – but the leader accepts his administration pursues “tough but fair” border management policies securing the EU’s external frontier. Explaining the length of time needed to bring the cargo ship “to safe anchorage”, migration ministry officials in Athens laid the blame squarely with Ankara’s refusal to respond to repeated requests for the vessel to be sent back. Aid groups, piecing together the sequence of events, believe it was logistically impossible to push the ship back because it was so big and would have required the Greek coastguard also entering Turkish waters. Once it became clear a pushback was impossible, Athens resorted to appealing to Turkey, said Olsen, whose organisation is among a network of NGOs accused by Greek officials of aiding and abetting people smugglers – allegations he strongly rejects. “Instead of the Greek coastguard, which is a rescue service, bringing them to safety, the government chose to keep them onboard and move them around as it tried to come to a deal with Turkey.","Greece accused of ‘biggest pushback in years’ of stricken refugee ship The Turkish-flagged Murat 729 had been heading for Italy when it ran into engine trouble off Crete and issued a mayday call on 28 October.

Kavala has been incarcerated without being convicted for more than four years, prompting claims of political persecution against the businessman amid international criticism of Ankara’s crackdown on opponents. “This trial is yet another brazen episode in the relentless political persecution for which the European court has condemned Turkey,” said Nils Muižnieks, Amnesty International’s Europe director. The Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, warned Turkey in September it would begin proceedings unless it released Kavala before a ministerial meeting next week. The process could lead to Turkey’s membership or voting rights being suspended, further isolating Ankara and threatening a key link to Europe.

Turkiye has hit back at claims by the United States that it agreed to a ceasefire with Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, and has vowed to continue working to clear them from the territory – a military operation that was launched after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A senior Turkish defence official on Thursday rubbished claims made by US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller that a Washington-brokered ceasefire between Turkish-backed rebels and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) around the Syrian city of Manbij had been extended until the end of this week. The SDF is supported by Washington in its fight against ISIL, but Ankara views it as a “terrorist organisation”, alleging links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a four-decade armed rebellion on Turkish soil. On Thursday, the Turkish official described Miller’s statement as “a slip of the tongue”, saying it was “out of the question” for Turkiye to talk to the SDF, a group spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which is seen an extension of the PKK. Turkiye regards the PKK, YPG and SDF as “terrorist” groups. The US and Turkiye’s Western allies also list the PKK as “terrorist”, but not the YPG and the SDF. Renewed fighting between Turkish-backed factions and Syrian Kurdish fighters comes more than a week after fighters led by opposition group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) toppled Syria’s longtime strongman Bashar al-Assad. Reporting from Istanbul, Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu said that Turkiye believed it was up to the new Syrian administration to remove “foreign fighters” – an allusion to PKK members of the YPG –  from its territory. “Turkiye considers all those PKK ranks within the YPG as foreign fighters and the Turkish foreign minister said these foreign fighters … within the opposition factions should be out of Syria, especially as there is a new Syrian administration and a national army is expected to be established,” she said. If the new administration was unable to remove foreign fighters from its territory, Turkiye could potentially intervene, she added.","Turkiye refutes US claims of ceasefire with Syrian Kurdish fighters Ankara vows to continue operations in northern Syria as fears grow over an assault on the Kurdish-held border town of Kobane.

A coalition of 22 press freedom organisations said the bill “provides a framework for extensive censorship of online information and the criminalisation of journalism, which will enable the government to further subdue and control public debate in the lead up to Turkey’s general elections in 2023”. The new law means those found guilty of intentionally publishing disinformation or “fake news” that the authorities claim spreads panic, endangers security forces or the overall health of Turkish society could be sentenced to up to three years in prison. “It criminalises what the authorities call disinformation without defining what that actually means,” said the journalist Emre Kızılkaya, head of the Turkish branch of the Vienna-based International Press Institute, one of the organisations to condemn the bill. Journalists, press freedom watchdogs and even the Council of Europe condemned the bill as it slowly moved through its debate stages in Turkey’s parliament, urging the government to drop it before it became law. Turkey currently ranks 149 out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index for 2022, and campaigners fear these additional restrictions will affect the media’s ability to accurately cover Turkey’s forthcoming election, expected in or before June. Campaigners, including the Turkish Journalists’ Union (TGS), also criticised the government over the choice to consult American social media companies over the bill while failing “to seek the views of the journalism organisations in Turkey who will be directly affected”. Turkish authorities previously clashed with Meta, Facebook’s owner, over a demand that every social media company with more than 1 million users appoint a local representative required to answer to the government, and to store users’ data locally. “This will also force digital platforms like Google News or Facebook to reveal their algorithms to the government, showing the Turkish state what content they boost and what they suppress,” said Kızılkaya.","Turkey: new ‘disinformation’ law could jail journalists for three years Turkey’s parliament has ratified a sweeping new law that would see those accused of spreading disinformation jailed for up to three years.

Turkey's energy minister Fatih Donmez confirmed there had been serious damage to the infrastructure, but did not mention the explosions. Turkey lies in one of the world's most active earthquake zones. The country's worst earthquake disaster was in 1939 when 33,000 people died in Turkey's eastern Erzincan province. The Turkish Red Crescent has called for citizens to make blood donations, and the organisation's president, Kerem Kınık, said on Twitter that additional blood and medical products were being sent to the affected region. Following an international appeal for help, Turkey's President Erdogan said 45 countries had offered support. The European Union is sending search and rescue teams to Turkey, while rescuers from the Netherlands and Romania are already on their way. Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered help to both Turkey and Syria, as has Iran. Turkey's interior minister, Suleymon Soylu, said 10 cities were affected by the initial quake including Hatay, Osmaniye, Adiyaman, Malatya, Sanliurfa, Adana, Diyarbakir and Kilis. A volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group, which operates in rebel-controlled areas of north-western Syria, fought back tears as he described the devastation in Sarmada, near the border with Turkey.",NEGATIVE,0.9903311729431152

The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that Sakir Ozkan Torunlar was being recalled “in view of the unfolding humanitarian tragedy in Gaza caused by the continuing attacks by Israel against civilians and Israel’s refusal of calls for a ceasefire and the continuous and unhindered flow of humanitarian aid.” The move has come as Ankara’s rhetoric has become increasingly critical of Israel, which has killed about 9,500 Palestinians, including 3,900 children, in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed about 1,400 people. Spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lior Haiat, criticised the decision as “another step by the Turkish president that sides with the Hamas terrorist organization,” in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Turkey hosts members of Hamas, which it does not consider a “terrorist” organisation like the United States and the European Union. On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he was breaking off contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We have written him off,” Turkish media quoted Erdogan as saying. But he added that this does not mean Turkey is cutting its relations with Israel and his intelligence chief is in contact with Israeli and Palestinian authorities as well as Hamas. Erdogan also said that when the war is over, Turkey wants “to see Gaza as a peaceful region that is a part of an independent Palestinian state, in line with 1967 borders, with territorial integrity, and with East Jerusalem as its capital”. Last month, Israeli diplomats had left Turkey for security reasons after many pro-Palestinian demonstrations erupted across the country.

Saudi officials said the journalist was killed in a ""rogue operation"" by a team of agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom, while Turkish officials said the agents acted on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government. Khashoggi first visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 28 September 2018 to obtain a Saudi document stating that he was divorced, so that he could marry his Turkish fiancée, Hatice Cengiz. ""He did not believe that something bad could happen on Turkish soil,"" Ms Cengiz wrote in the Post. Despite reassuring friends that he would not face any problems inside, he gave Ms Cengiz two mobile phones and told her to call an adviser to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he did not come back out. On 15 November, Saudi Arabia's deputy public prosecutor Shalaan al-Shalaan said the murder was ordered by the head of a ""negotiations team"" sent to Istanbul by the Saudi deputy intelligence chief to bring Khashoggi back to the kingdom ""by means of persuasion"" or, if that failed, ""by force"". Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival. Istanbul's chief prosecutor, Irfan Fidan, said on 31 October 2018 that the journalist was suffocated almost as soon as entered the consulate, and that his body was dismembered and destroyed. Writing in the Washington Post on 2 November, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared it had been established that Khashoggi ""was killed in cold blood by a death squad"" and ""that his murder was premeditated"". In March 2020, the Istanbul chief prosecutor formally charged Saad al-Qahtani, Ahmad Asiri and 18 other Saudi nationals with murder. Saudi Arabia rejected Turkey's extradition request, so all 20 men were put on trial in absentia in Istanbul in July 2020.

Osman Kavala, 64, has been held since October 2017 on accusations of financing the protests which began as small demonstrations in an Istanbul park and snowballed into nationwide anti-government unrest. The sentencing marks Turkish authorities’ deepest and most public crackdown on dissent and freedom of assembly in the past decade and threatens to damage Turkish relations with Europe after heavy criticism of the marathon trial. “It’s a horrifying decision, and not one that was in any way expected,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, speaking from outside the courtroom. “It’s completely in defiance of Turkey’s obligations to international law,” said Webb. Kavala appeared in court via video link from Silivri high security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. “After losing four and a half years of my life, the only aspect I can find solace in is the possibility that what I experienced could contribute to confronting the crucial problems in the judiciary of Turkey, and so those tried in future could receive better treatment.” Small protests against an urban development plan in Istanbul’s Gezi Park that began in 2013 quickly transformed into huge anti-government protests. Kavala was accused of financing the protests after he paid for a folding table and some snacks for protesters, and arrested in the Istanbul airport in 2017. Last October, Turkey declared 10 western ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, “persona non grata”, after they issued a statement condemning Kavala’s continued detention, before later reversing the decision. The trial was repeatedly condemned as unjust and politically motivated by rights groups as well as the Council of Europe, whose ministers took the highly unusual decision earlier this year to formally begin the process of accusing Turkey of infringement, after Turkish authorities refused to release Kavala after a ruling by the European court of human rights. “It is regrettable that the Turkish authorities have refused to execute the respective ECHR’s ruling. Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU’s concerns regarding Turkish judiciary’s adherence to international and European standards,” they said.","Philanthropist sentenced to life in Turkey in ‘travesty’ trial over Gezi Park protests A Turkish court has sentenced a leading philanthropist to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of “attempting to overthrow the government by force” in connection with the Gezi Park anti-government protests in 2013.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/05/us-shoots-down-turkish-drone-syria,US shoots down Turkish drone flying near its troops in Syria,6 Oct 2023 00.16 CEST,"Turkey’s defence ministry says the device did not belong to the country’s armed forces The US has shot down an armed Turkish drone that was operating near its troops in Syria, the first time Washington has brought down an aircraft of its Nato ally. A Turkish defence ministry official said the drone did not belong to the Turkish armed forces, but did not say whose property it was. The incident on Thursday came days after Turkey’s national intelligence agency carried out strikes in Syria against Kurdish militant targets after a bomb attack in Ankara last weekend. The Pentagon spokesperson, Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, said Turkish drones had been seen carrying out airstrikes in Hasakah, Syria on Thursday morning about 1km (0.6 miles) away from US troops. A few hours later a Turkish drone came within less than half a kilometre of US troops. “We have no indication that Turkey was intentionally targeting US forces,” Ryder told reporters. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke with his Turkish counterpart after the incident, a call Ryder said was “fruitful”. The incident comes at a delicate moment for US-Turkish relations, with the US hoping Turkey will ratify Nato membership for Sweden. While the US has not shot down a Turkish aircraft before, tensions have flared and there have been close calls. In 2019, US troops in northern Syria came under artillery fire from Turkish positions. US-allied Syrian Kurdish forces said Turkish attacks had killed eight people in an escalation prompted by the Ankara attack by Kurdish militants. US support for Kurdish forces in northern Syria has long caused tension with Turkey, which views them as a wing of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). That group claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attack in Ankara near government buildings. On Wednesday, Turkey said the two attackers had come from Syria. On Thursday, a Turkish defence ministry official said a ground operation into Syria was one option Turkey could consider. Turkey has mounted several previous incursions into northern Syria against the Syrian-Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) group. The official said: “Our only goal is to eliminate the terrorist organisations that pose a threat to Turkey. Security forces in north-eastern Syria said Turkey launched a series of attacks on Thursday with more than 15 drones entering the region’s airspace and hitting targets including oil and gas stations and infrastructure.","US shoots down Turkish drone flying near its troops in Syria Turkey’s defence ministry says the device did not belong to the country’s armed forces The US has shot down an armed Turkish drone that was operating near its troops in Syria, the first time Washington has brought down an aircraft of its Nato ally.

Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. Perhaps it was merely campaign rhetoric, but it reflects a mindset in Turkey and potentially in other countries. Erdoğan’s first test will come at the Nato summit in Vilnius where he will be asked to lift Turkey’s veto on the Nato membership of Sweden. Stockholm is toughening its anti-terror laws to please Ankara and is willing to study evidence that the Kurdish community in Sweden has become a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and Turkey.

Footage from the scene broadcast by local media just after the attack, which took place at 3:30pm local time (12:30 GMT), showed huge clouds of smoke and a large fire raging at the site in Kahramankazan, a small town some 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Ankara. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Ankara, said some 15,000 people work at the TUSAS campus in Kahramankazan. Turkish politicians and world leaders have condemned the attack, with Putin offering Erdogan his “condolences in connection with the terror attack” at the start of their meeting in the Russian city of Kazan on the sidelines of the BRICS summit of major emerging market nations that groups Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. “NATO stands with our ally Turkey,” said the head of the alliance, Mark Rutte, in a post on X. Turkish opposition leader Ozgur Ozel of the Republican People’s Party (CHP) released a statement condemning the attack and saying he “condemns terrorism, no matter who or where it comes from”. The main pro-Kurdish DEM party also condemned the attack, saying it was “noteworthy that the attack took place just as Turkish society was talking about a solution and the possibility of dialogue” with the PKK. The attack occurred as a major trade fair for the defence and aerospace industries was taking place in Istanbul, which was visited this week by Ukraine’s top diplomat. TUSAS is one of Turkey’s most important defence and aviation companies. Turkey’s defence sector, which is widely known for its Bayraktar drones, accounts for nearly 80 percent of the nation’s export revenues with revenues expected to top $10.2bn in 2023.","At least five killed in attack on aerospace firm near Turkey’s Ankara At least five people have been killed and 22 others wounded in an attack on the headquarters of Turkey’s aerospace and defence company, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS), near the capital Ankara, Turkey’s interior minister has said. “Two terrorists were neutralised” in the incident at the headquarters of the state-run firm, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya wrote on X on Wednesday.

Turkish territory along its southern border with Syria provided vital lifelines for rebels during the early stages of the Syrian civil war, and formed an essential exit point for millions of civilians who fled violence.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused both countries, especially Sweden, of providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorists”. Erdogan also called on Finland and Sweden to lift an arms embargo on Turkey they had imposed in 2019 after Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria. He said these were important “security concerns” for Turkey that had to be resolved before he agreed to NATO’s enlargement. The three nations signed an agreement on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Madrid last year, in which Finland and Sweden pledged to address Turkey’s security demands.

The city hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people, and it has a diverse electorate from different political, ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds. Control Istanbul and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.

Ihsan Aktas agrees that whoever wins will have enormous influence beyond Istanbul: ""When you have the backing of Istanbul, you directly become an actor in the national politics. The city hosts a fifth of Turkey's population of nearly 85 million people, and it has a diverse electorate from different political, ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds. Control Istanbul and you control a significant portion of Turkey's economy including trade, tourism and finance.

Turkey has agreed to allow Sweden to join NATO after closed-door negotiations between NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and the leaders of the two countries ahead of a NATO summit in Lithuania. Hours after Ankara’s decision was revealed, the administration of United States President Joe Biden announced it will move forward with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey in consultation with the US Congress, in what seemed to be a trade-off for Ankara’s green light to Stockholm’s NATO membership. Separately, the Pentagon said on Tuesday that US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin discussed his country’s role in Turkey’s military modernisation with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler on the phone – another indication that negotiations over Sweden’s entry were helped along by a US-Turkey defence deal. Ankara sought to purchase US F-16s and modernise the ones it already owns as compensation for its 2019 removal from a US-led international programme developing and producing new F-35 fighter jets. Washington sacked Turkey from the popular scheme after its purchase of the S-400 defence system from Russia despite warnings from the US. The development led to a bilateral crisis between the two allies and Washington’s imposition of sanctions on Turkey in December 2020 in the area of defence under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) – the first time such sanctions targeted a NATO member. This made Ankara’s veto on Sweden’s NATO bid a thorn in an already rocky relationship with the West for more than a year. According to Galip Dalay, a non-resident senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, Sweden’s membership of NATO has been a subheading in Turkey’s agenda towards the West, and more specifically towards the US. “Ankara’s expectations over F-16s from Washington have been apparent in this process from day one. However, Turkey also sought a general normalisation and improvement in its relations with the EU countries and the US in general through Sweden’s process, using it as a peg,” Dalay told Al Jazeera.","Why Turkey changed its stance on Sweden’s NATO membership Ankara supports Stockholm’s bid after it receives backing on key conditions that range from buying US F-16s to visa-free travel to Europe’s Schengen area.

A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdoğan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first-round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters. At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdoğan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round. Kılıçdaroğlu has offered voters a chance to end Erdoğan’s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey’s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdoğan’s tenure, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey’s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. Kılıçdaroğlu’s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the runoff, as well as signing an agreement with Özdağ including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey whom he previously relied on for support in the first round. The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. “This is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second-round vote in a presidential election. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey’s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdoğan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems. Voters in the town of Kahramanmaraş, close to the epicentres of twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdoğan was a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival.

Because Nato operates by consensus, it is possible for one country in the 30-strong military alliance to block an application, giving Ankara leverage when the two countries sought to join earlier this year. Turkey said it was satisfied with the outcome. “Turkey has made significant gains in the fight against terrorist organisations,” said a statement released by Erdoğan’s office on Tuesday, adding: “Turkey got what it wanted.” The text of the memorandum signed by all three leaders says that Finland and Sweden will “extend their full support” to Turkey in matters of national security. Finland and Sweden affirmed in the deal there were no national arms embargoes relating to sales to Turkey and all three countries said they would work together on extradition requests. Sweden is home to 100,000 Kurdish refugees and Turkey has called for the extradition of individuals it says are linked to the PKK or the Syrian YPG. Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden had agreed to a “further amending their domestic legislation” to give Turkey the anti-terror reassurances it had sought, and would be “cracking down on PKK activities” and “entering into an agreement with Turkey on extradition”.","Turkey lifts objections to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bid Ankara had previously blocked the Nordic countries from joining the alliance over concerns about arms exports and terrorism A last minute agreement has been reached between Turkey, Finland and Sweden to allow the two Nordic countries to become Nato members on the eve of the military alliance’s summit in Madrid.

The Turkish leader said he told the same thing to US President Joe Biden when the pair spoke by phone on Sunday. Turkey wants Sweden to crack down on groups that it considers national security threats, including the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the People’s Protection Units, or YPG, which Ankara considers the Syrian branch of the PKK. Ankara also wants Stockholm to extradite suspects whom it calls “terrorists” and lift an arms ban it has imposed on Turkey.

Istanbul, Turkey – Across much of the world, local elections generate little interest beyond the town hall but in Turkey, voting for officials ranging from metropolitan mayors to neighbourhood representatives grips the nation for weeks ahead of polling day. Despite having turned out for presidential and parliamentary polls only 10 months ago, Turkish television and newspapers have been full of news, opinion and debate on the March 31 local vote. Across the country, voters will elect more than 23,000 officials but most attention will be on the mayors picked to run Turkey’s 30 largest cities. This is especially true in Istanbul, the country’s most populous city and its economic powerhouse, where an opposition victory in 2019 was seen as a setback in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s largely flawless electoral record. Victory for the Republican People’s Party (CHP) in Istanbul five years ago ended the city’s 25 years of rule by Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and its conservative predecessors. The loss of Istanbul also struck a personal note for Erdogan, who was born and raised in the city and served as its mayor in the 1990s. Ejder Batur, deputy chairman of the AK Party’s Istanbul branch, cited Erdogan’s spell as mayor as one of the factors behind his success on the national stage and a sign of why local polls have such significance. “Istanbul has a symbolic significance in every election and all the big cities now have CHP mayors apart from Bursa, the fourth-biggest city,” said CHP Deputy Chairman Ilhan Uzgel. Istanbul’s 2019 result was mirrored in the capital Ankara and Antalya, leaving the CHP in control of four of the five biggest cities, accounting for one-third of Turkey’s population. Retaking Istanbul would also give the AK Party the opportunity to sideline its CHP Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is seen as a potential presidential challenger in the future. This year’s election will see some 35 political parties taking part across Turkey. The level of participation is such that voters in Istanbul will be given a ballot paper nearly a metre (3 feet) wide to accommodate 49 mayoral candidates, including 27 independents.","Turkey’s opposition in electoral battle to keep hold of major cities CHP has control of local government in Istanbul and Ankara, but may find it hard to keep hold of them in March 31 local elections.

Erdoğan’s success will have significant consequences for Turkey’s economy, minority groups and refugees, and the country’s position on the international stage – and it could pave the way for a significant consolidation of his power. Before the first round of the Turkish election, most analysts viewed a victory for opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu as a real possibility. His 4% margin – comfortable, but not a landslide – suggests that there will be “no real change of course in Turkey,” says Soner Cagaptay, senior fellow at the Washington Institute thinktank in the US. “If you see what’s happening in Turkey as simply about manipulating the state, you’re ignoring the really broad social support for what Erdoğan represents,” Ziya Meral said. “That comes with a subtext of Turkish-US relations,” Meral said. “If there is progress in Washington on the sale of F-16 fighter jets that Turkey wants, or if Biden hosts Erdoğan in the White House, some sort of normalisation is possible.” Meanwhile, Erdoğan will press on with attempts to find new investment for the Turkish economy among previously adversarial countries in the Middle East “and wherever he can find it”, Meral said, with the old goal of EU membership in tatters. Turkey’s Kurdish minority were seen as important to Kılıçdaroğlu’s hopes of victory. That is because, since 2015 and the collapse of the peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – which Turkey views as a terrorist group – Erdoğan has prosecuted a wide-ranging crackdown. Meanwhile, Erdoğan has frequently attacked the rights of Turkey’s LGBTQ+ community with appeals to the importance of “a strong family”.

Friday’s announcement pushes one of Turkey’s largest voting blocs behind opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the People’s Republican Party, and further complicates Erdogan’s path to achieving more than two decades in power. The Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), the third-largest in Turkey’s parliament, decided last month not to field a presidential candidate and strongly hinted that it would back Kilicdaroglu without officially endorsing his candidacy. “In this historic election, we call on the people of Turkey to vote for the Labour and Freedom Alliance in the parliamentary elections and for Kemal Kilicdaroglu in the presidential elections,” the HDP and its allies said in a statement. HDP co-leader Mithat Sancar called the upcoming vote “the most crucial in Turkey’s history”. The HDP has won more than 10 percent of the vote in past national elections and represents a community accounting for about a fifth of Turkey’s population. Erdogan lifted linguistic and cultural restrictions on the community and tried to end a bloody Kurdish struggle for an independent state in Turkey’s southeast through talks. Since then, Turkey has jailed thousands of activists and replaced dozens of elected HDP mayors with state trustees after accusing them of having ties with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). It has fought a war against the Turkish state since 1984 and is a designated “terrorist” group in Turkey, the European Union and the United States.","Turkey’s pro-Kurdish party backs Erdogan’s rival for president Turkey’s pro-Kurdish party and its leftist allies have asked their voters to back President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s main rival in the May 14 presidential election.

He studied business administration at Istanbul University, graduating in 1994, the year Erdogan became mayor, before going into his family’s construction business.

The mayor denied insulting electoral council members with the comment, saying he was responding to Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu, who called Imamoglu “a fool” and accused him of criticising Turkey. The CHP’s candidates won in 35 of Turkey’s 81 provinces, including Antalya, Denizli and Izmir.

On Tuesday night, the government announced the establishment of an operational “centre of excellence” by the Turkish national police and supported by the UK. The centre would aim to strengthen collaboration between the National Crime Agency and Home Office intelligence staff based in Turkey and their Turkish counterparts, the British government said. “Today we’re announcing a new partnership with one of the most important of those allies and that’s Turkey,” said Jenrick, adding that the nation’s geopolitical position on the cusp of Europe and Asia meant it was “absolutely critical” to work with Ankara. An investigation for the Guardian revealed in June that the Home Office provided more than £3m in funding to Turkish border forces in the previous year to prevent migrants reaching the UK. The UK government said on Tuesday that it would deploy more officers in Turkey to work on joint operations. When asked by the BBC if Turkey would stop the manufacturing of boats or block those passing through, Jenrick said it was “one element” the two nations were working on. The Turkey deal comes after Jenrick’s visit last month, when the immigration minister inspected the Turkish-Bulgarian border checkpoint at Kapıkule – the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe. The reinforced collaboration between the UK and Turkey will take centre stage at the forthcoming UK-Turkey migration dialogue meeting, scheduled for the autumn in London.

On Tuesday night, the government announced the establishment of an operational “centre of excellence” by the Turkish national police and supported by the UK. The centre would aim to strengthen collaboration between the National Crime Agency and Home Office intelligence staff based in Turkey and their Turkish counterparts, the British government said. “Today we’re announcing a new partnership with one of the most important of those allies and that’s Turkey,” said Jenrick, adding that the nation’s geopolitical position on the cusp of Europe and Asia meant it was “absolutely critical” to work with Ankara. An investigation for the Guardian revealed in June that the Home Office provided more than £3m in funding to Turkish border forces in the previous year to prevent migrants reaching the UK. The UK government said on Tuesday that it would deploy more officers in Turkey to work on joint operations. When asked by the BBC if Turkey would stop the manufacturing of boats or block those passing through, Jenrick said it was “one element” the two nations were working on. The Turkey deal comes after Jenrick’s visit last month, when the immigration minister inspected the Turkish-Bulgarian border checkpoint at Kapıkule – the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe. The reinforced collaboration between the UK and Turkey will take centre stage at the forthcoming UK-Turkey migration dialogue meeting, scheduled for the autumn in London.

The situation has left many Syrians in Turkey deeply worried about their future in the country. We all suffer from anxiety in this period,” said the man who was displaced eight years ago by Syria’s war and currently resides in Istanbul. According to the United Nations refugee agency, the vast majority of refugees in Turkey – 3.6 million – are Syrian living under “temporary protection status”. About 200,000 Syrians have been given Turkish citizenship since the Syrian war erupted in 2011, according to government figures. While Turkey initially welcomed the refugees, provided shelter and access to education with billions of euros in European Union funding, anti-refugee sentiment has grown in recent years, and refugees have become scapegoats for Turkey’s economic troubles, which has occasionally led to violence. Muhammad Siddik Yasar, who runs the Tarlabaşı Solidarity Association, a refugee solidarity group in Istanbul, said anti-refugee sentiment sharpened in the run-up to the elections. “Ogan is an interesting and important phenomenon in Turkish politics,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Besides moves towards a potential rapprochement, Erdogan’s government has pushed on with its plan for refugees to “resettle voluntarily” in areas in Syria under Turkish security control.

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has led Turkey for 20 years, has been announced as the winner of a run-off. Thousands of Erdoğan’s supporters have gathered on the streets of Ankara this evening to celebrate his victory. A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had “reiterated the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey” and that the two had “agreed to continue working closely together to address shared challenges”.

In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin called Erdoğan a “dear friend” and praised his “personal contribution to the strengthening of friendly Russian-Turkish relations”. “The election victory was a natural result of your selfless work as the head of the Republic of Turkey, clear evidence of the support of the Turkish people for your efforts to strengthen state sovereignty and conduct an independent foreign policy,” it said. Turkey is a member of Nato, and has been broadly supportive of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion last year, but has sought to maintain economic and diplomatic ties with Russia. President Erdoğan has called for “unity and solidarity” in a victory speech outside the presidential palace in Ankara.

Their three-day odyssey had a single goal: to get to the three-storey, Ottoman-style building on Apostolou Pavlou Street in the Greek port city where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish republic, was born and spent his early years. Few places are as indicative of Atatürk’s enduring appeal as the pink-walled abode where Turkey’s first president is thought to have been born in the spring of 1881. This year alone, nearly half a million visitors – the vast majority from Turkey – are expected to make the pilgrimage to Thessaloniki with the sole purpose of visiting the place that the legendary leader first called home. “Since January around 430,000 people have visited the house,” said an official at the Turkish consulate general, which shares grounds with the museum and oversees its daily management. “There are days when up to 6,000 visitors arrive, many on special tours in buses from Turkey, and the queues are very big.” “We love him,” said another visitor, Cansu Gigdem, who trained as an opera singer in Ankara, cupping her hands in a gesture of gratitude. “No figure is more iconic for secular Turks than Atatürk,” said Kostas Ifantis, a professor of international relations at Panteion University in Athens, referring to his programme of reforms that turned Turkey into a western-facing secular republic. How the house came to be given to the leader barely more than a decade after the Turkish republic’s foundation following the 1919-22 Greco-Turkish war is testimony to a rare period of rapprochement between the two rivals and the visionary policies of the former field marshal, then still known as Mustafa Kemal, and his Greek counterpart, Eleftherios Venizelos. In 1930 a Greek-Turkish friendship agreement was signed in Ankara by the two men; four years later, Venizelos proposed that Kemal be awarded the Nobel peace prize.

The UK government said there were “huge opportunities” for British businesses in exporting to Turkey, as one of the fastest-growing economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development group of nations, with trade between the two countries worth £26bn in 2022. Ministers had announced in July last year their intention to hold trade talks with Turkey, and last November began months of consultation with businesses and trade groups over the UK’s priorities for an agreement. The talks come at a delicate moment in ties between Turkey and western governments after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who holds warmer relations with Russia than other Nato member states, held up the progress of Sweden’s membership until his government granted its backing in January. Kemi Badenoch, the UK trade secretary, said Turkey was an “important economic and strategic partner” and that a trade deal could help boost exports of British services. Badenoch launched the talks in London on Thursday alongside her Turkish counterpart, Ömer Bolat. A deal could also give British consumers improved choice and better access to imported Turkish goods such as nuts, bulgar wheat and tomatoes, the government said. Britain already has a trade deal with Turkey, which was rolled over after Brexit in a continuity agreement to minimise disruption. Before leaving the EU, the UK benefited from trading with Turkey through an EU-Turkey customs union. Turkey had launched membership talks with the EU in 2005, but the accession process and efforts to expand its customs deal have since stalled amid concerns in EU capitals over the gradual erosion of democracy under Erdoğan. While Turkey’s economy has grown at a rapid pace over Erdoğan’s 20 years in power, it has also been rocked by successive crises, including bouts of galloping inflation and crashes in the Turkish lira triggered by the president’s unorthodox stance on economic policy. The UK government said Turkey presented significant opportunities for British businesses, including in transport, engineering, financial services, manufacturing and tech, driven in part by the country’s decarbonisation efforts and significant investment in rail.","UK embarks on post-Brexit trade talks with Turkey Talks offer ‘huge opportunities’ but come at a delicate time after Ankara held up Sweden’s accession to Nato The UK and Turkey have started talks about a post-Brexit free trade agreement targeting the service sector of the economy.

Ankara has buried the hatchet and re-engaged with several countries it has long been at odds with, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel. Now, the deadly February 6 earthquakes appear to have paved the way for Turkey to mend its ties with yet more of its neighbours. Before the earthquakes, which claimed tens of thousands of lives and flattened entire cities across Turkey’s southeast, the country’s relations with Greece were on the verge of collapse. But everything changed after the earthquakes hit and the scale of devastation Turkey is facing became apparent. Turkey responded with genuine gratitude, leading Dendias to say he welcomes “the shift in Ankara’s tone”. This dramatic improvement in relations in the face of a humanitarian crisis was not particularly surprising for long-term observers of Turkey-Greece relations, as the two countries had successfully engaged in so-called “earthquake diplomacy” for the first time in 1999. Following a deadly quake in Turkey’s northwestern Marmara region in August that year, then-Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou embarked on a journey to improve the neighbouring nations’ relations. The consequent rapprochement paved the way for the EU’s December 1999 decision to grant Turkey official candidate status. The earthquakes also led to an ease in Turkey-Armenia tensions. Putting its longstanding differences and disputes with Ankara aside, the Armenian government sent food, medicine, drinking water and other emergency supplies to devastated cities and towns soon after the quakes. More importantly, the aid from Armenia crossed into Turkey through the land border which has been sealed since the early 1990s. On the back of these goodwill gestures, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan visited Ankara on February 15 to discuss the ongoing efforts to normalise ties between Armenia and Turkey. There is no doubt that Turkey is on significantly better footing to improve its relations with Armenia and Greece now than it was just a month ago. But could the ongoing “earthquake diplomacy” truly transform Turkey’s relations with its two neighbours, both of whom – for reasons of history – loom large in Turkish society’s imagination? Today, amid a global economic downturn and a war at the heart of Europe, Greece has much reason to try and improve its relations with Turkey.","Facing tragedy, Turkey mends ties with Greece and Armenia In the past few years, Turkey’s foreign policy has been defined by resets.

He said the sunrise of 20 July “put an end to the 11-year darkness enveloping” the Turkish Cypriots, who constituted 18% of the island’s population in 1974. “The Cyprus peace operation saved Turkish Cypriots from cruelty and brought them to freedom,” he told the jubilant crowd who had gathered in Nicosia, the island’s war-split capital, despite the blistering heat. Turkey launched the amphibious invasion, code-named Attila, five days after a coup was ordered and set in motion by the military junta in Athens with the aim of annexing Cyprus to Greece. The takeover, which saw the island’s president, Archbishop Makarios III, flee the country, followed years of inter-communal violence after a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots began to unravel after the nation’s independence from Britain in 1960. Over the course of the month-long Turkish offensive thousands were left dead, missing, tortured, raped and taken prisoner. By 16 August, the invading troops had seized 37% of the island’s north with an estimated 200,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots displaced in the process. The country has not only earned the reputation as a “graveyard” for mediators but is an emotional issue that is a constant thorn in relations between Nato members Greece and Turkey.

""I stand ready to work with President Erdogan and Turkey on enhancing defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area.

Mr Stoltenberg said Turkey and Sweden had addressed ""Turkey's legitimate security concerns"" and as a result Sweden had amended its constitution, changed its laws, expanded its counter-terrorism operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) and resumed arms exports to Turkey.

The redesigned space was the scene of a flurry of activity on Friday, Turkey’s independence day: flower arrangements were hurriedly being taken inside while workers unrolled red carpets before the evening inauguration and the premiere of an opera commissioned for the occasion. Since the Republic of Turkey was founded a century ago, Taksim Square has functioned as a cultural and political hub. A massive new mosque on the opposite side of Taksim, long one of the pious Turkish leader’s pet projects, was completed earlier this year, giving an area long associated with the republic’s secular founding principles a new religious identity. The reopening of the cultural centre is seen by many in Turkey’s highly polarised society as restoring an ideological balance in an important public space. The long-awaited renovation should also be celebrated as the return of a cultural lodestar, said Gülper Refiğ, a musicology professor and longstanding figure in Turkey’s performing arts scene. “Atatürk commissioned the first Turkish opera, by Adnan Saygun in 1934, and the new one is commissioned by the president and written by one of Saygun’s students, Hasan Uçarsu, a very talented composer.” Uçarsu’s two-act opera focuses on one of the greatest artists in Ottoman history, Mimar Sinan, a prolific 16th-century architect who built Istanbul’s breathtaking Süleymaniye mosque and Edirne’s Selimiye mosque for the ruling sultans. As Turkey’s tourism industry struggles to recover from the pandemic, the municipality and the national culture ministry are seeking to cement Istanbul’s reputation as a global arts destination. The Contemporary Istanbul art fair has just successfully staged the city’s first international art event since before the Covid-19 shutdowns, and several new initiatives are on the way. Derelict shipyards on the Golden Horn are being transformed into a cultural quarter, and the new Galataport development on the Bosphorus will eventually house the new Renzo Piano-designed Istanbul Museum of Modern Art and the rehomed National Museum of Painting and Sculpture.","Atatürk cultural centre reopens in boost to Istanbul’s arts scene Istanbul’s Atatürk cultural centre has opened its doors for the first time in 13 years, breathing new life into the city’s arts scene.

The long-awaited renovation should also be celebrated as the return of a cultural lodestar, said Gülper Refiğ, a musicology professor and longstanding figure in Turkey’s performing arts scene. “Atatürk commissioned the first Turkish opera, by Adnan Saygun in 1934, and the new one is commissioned by the president and written by one of Saygun’s students, Hasan Uçarsu, a very talented composer.” Uçarsu’s two-act opera focuses on one of the greatest artists in Ottoman history, Mimar Sinan, a prolific 16th-century architect who built Istanbul’s breathtaking Süleymaniye mosque and Edirne’s Selimiye mosque for the ruling sultans. As Turkey’s tourism industry struggles to recover from the pandemic, the municipality and the national culture ministry are seeking to cement Istanbul’s reputation as a global arts destination. The Contemporary Istanbul art fair has just successfully staged the city’s first international art event since before the Covid-19 shutdowns, and several new initiatives are on the way. Derelict shipyards on the Golden Horn are being transformed into a cultural quarter, and the new Galataport development on the Bosphorus will eventually house the new Renzo Piano-designed Istanbul Museum of Modern Art and the rehomed National Museum of Painting and Sculpture.",POSITIVE,0.9950786828994751

With a crowd of more than 30,000 in Azerbaijan's capital city effectively making this a home game for Turkey, Wales responded to the hostile atmosphere with a vibrant, attacking display in which they cut their opponents open at will. After a host of missed chances in a breathless first half, Gareth Bale played a brilliant lofted pass through the heart of the Turkish defence for Aaron Ramsey, who brought the ball down and finished elegantly. Although Turkey came back strongly, Wales squandered a glorious opportunity to consolidate their lead when captain Bale ballooned a penalty over the bar. There were some nervous moments for the Welsh defence as they withstood Turkish attacks - with Danny Ward making a vital late save to deny Merih Demiral. Relive the action from Wales v Turkey, plus reaction But regardless of events in Rome, this impressive performance and result against Turkey - tipped by many before this tournament as potential dark horses - marked a remarkable transformation from Robert Page's side. With Bale swapping wings with Daniel James, an absolute menace for the Turkish defence, there was a purpose and pace to Wales' game which had been lacking in their opening fixture. Bale picked up possession near halfway, saw Ramsey's run in behind Turkey's defence and found his team-mate with an expertly measured chip. Fortunate not to be further behind but willed on by a vociferous, overwhelmingly Turkish-Azeri crowd, Turkey were set up in a far more attacking manner for the second half with full-backs and wingers pushing further upfield. That was one of several Turkish efforts in a period of intense pressure and, having withstood it, Wales were presented with a gift of a chance to extend their lead. Bale took on Mehmet Zeki Celik inside the penalty area and, as the Turkey right-back dangled his leg, pushed the ball ahead of him and was taken down. Turkey were not done yet - Demiral's powerful header was well saved by Ward with just three minutes left - but it was Wales who had the final say.","Wales take huge step with Turkey win Wales took a significant stride towards qualifying for the second round of Euro 2020 as they overcame Turkey after a gripping encounter in Baku.

Athens, Greece – So-called earthquake diplomacy is a potential opportunity for Ankara and Athens to mend fences after elections in both countries this month. That seems to be the prevailing theory in the US State Department, after earthquakes in February killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and left 1.5 million homeless. Greece was the first country to send emergency assistance and extraction teams to Turkey, and the foreign and defence ministers of both countries have since met and proclaimed improved relations. After expressing his condolences for a rail disaster in late February that killed 57 people in Greece, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan restated Ankara’s disputes about Greek sovereignty over the east Aegean islands. Last year, Erdogan’s junior coalition partner caused a stir when he published a map depicting some islands as Turkish. His defence minister, Nikolaos Panagiotopoulos, said their publication was a sign of the fact that “long-term Turkish goals don’t change”. Nonetheless, there is a persistent rumour that after Turkey’s May 14 elections and Greece’s May 21 vote, the US will encourage Germany to undertake a diplomatic initiative to get Greek-Turkish talks going.

The Turkish Ministry of Trade said on Tuesday it will no longer send to Israel items in 54 categories spanning iron and steel products, jet fuel, construction equipment, machines, cement, granites, chemicals, pesticides and bricks. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz hit back at Turkey’s announcement saying Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is “once again sacrificing the economic interests of the people of Turkey for his support of the Hamas murderers in Gaza”. He added Israel would take “measures that will harm the Turkish economy”, including banning some Turkish imports, asking United States-based organisations to stop investing in Turkey, and calling “our friends in the American Congress” to impose sanctions on Turkey. The announcement of the trade curbs came a day after Turkey promised “step by step” reprisals against Israel after it blocked Turkish cargo military planes from dropping aid over Gaza. “We will continue our support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters until the bloodshed in Gaza stops and they live in a free Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the basis of the 1967 borders,” Erdogan said on Tuesday, adding that Turkey has sent 45,000 tons of humanitarian aid to the region. Israel and Turkey pulled back their ambassadors from their respective capitals shortly after the start of the war. The two countries have been in a war of words since, with Erdogan calling Israel a “terror state”, emphasising Turkish support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and condemning Israel’s decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territory during a hearing at the International Court of Justice. But Ankara had not imposed any actual measures against Israel until Tuesday, with trades falling since October 7 but experts increasing each month this year so far, according to data published by the Turkish Exporters Assembly. The Turkish government has faced domestic criticism over its commercial ties to Israel during the war, something that was seen by many as a factor contributing to a major defeat in local elections at the end of March.","Turkey restricts exports of 54 products to Israel until Gaza ceasefire Turkey says it will impose restrictions on exports to Israel until there is a ceasefire and increased aid in the Gaza Strip after the Israeli government refused to allow it to airdrop aid over the besieged and bombarded territory.

A small window of diplomatic opportunity may have opened due to Turkey’s recent interest in negotiating its relations with the European Union, especially on visa-free travel and the customs union. Cyprus – a former British colony – has been split since Ankara sent in troops in 1974, seizing its northern third in response to a coup orchestrated by the junta then in power in Athens aimed at uniting the country with Greece. However, the recent completion of elections in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus gives politicians greater room for manoeuvre if they wish to revive talks after a poorly prepared UN-led conference in Switerzland failed in 2017. Since then Turkey has become even more committed to a two-state solution for the island, but Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus (the self-styled “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”) is recognised only by Turkey, leaving it dependent on Ankara both economically and in terms of security. There are up to 30,000 Turkish troops on the island. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is due to visit the island on Thursday to mark the occupation and to open a new airport in the north. Some argue that Turkey’s desire to reopen talks on its relationship with the EU might give Brussels some leverage to persuade Erdoğan to re-examine a Cyprus strategy that is probably draining Ankara of badly needed funds. To Washington’s relief, Erdoğan has in principle lifted his veto on Sweden joining Nato, but appears to be waiting on confirmation from Washington that the US Senate is willing to supply F-16 jets to Turkey. He wants written undertakings that Turkey will not use the F-16s to continue overflights of Greek islands, creating an elaborate piece of choreography that affects not only Turkey, Sweden and Nato, but also Cyprus. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is due to address the EU foreign affairs council where he is likely to update EU foreign ministers on US relations with Turkey. Ersin Tatar, the elected Turkish Cypriot leader, has opposed unifying the island and wants the north of Cyprus to be recognised as an independent country.","Cyprus seeks to revive peace talks with Turkey over divided island Ankara’s recent interest in improving EU access seen as window of opportunity to restart diplomatic process Cypriot diplomats are seeking to revive peace talks on the divided island with proposed appointments of UN and EU envoys in a bid to find a federal solution five decades after occupation of the north of the island by Turkish troops.

Scientists who talked to Al Jazeera said a major temblor is highly likely to strike Turkey’s largest city as the nation mourns the deaths of tens of thousands of people in the country’s southeast a week ago. The twin tremors affected 10 provinces in Turkey and killed thousands of others in Syria, and the death toll continues to rise in both countries. The massive disaster raised the question of earthquake preparedness in Istanbul, Turkey’s business and tourism capital hosting some 16 million people. Sukru Ersoy, a professor of geology at Turkey’s Yildiz Technical University, said historical data of past earthquakes suggests that one on the fault line under the Marmara Sea is near. Huseyin Alan, chairman of the Chamber of Geological Engineers, agreed: “A magnitude 7.0 or higher earthquake is expected in Istanbul according to the data we have.” A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the western part of Turkey’s Marmara region in August 1999 and killed at least 17,500 people. Turkey is located in a region that harbours several tectonic plates, and earthquakes are much more likely to happen around the borders between plates. The North Anatolian Fault line divides the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, and it goes through the Marmara Sea, which is south of Istanbul. Istanbul produced 30.4 percent of Turkey’s gross domestic product in 2021, according to official data, making it the heart of economic activity in the country. The megalopolis also hosts the country’s most vital production facilities that could deeply hurt Turkey’s industrial sector if they are damaged by a powerful temblor. Ersoy said severe seismic activity affecting Istanbul and the rest of the country should be at the top of the agenda for authorities. “[Preparing for] earthquakes should be the top project in both Istanbul and Turkey. We should start now, start fast and mobilise all the resources to prepare for an earthquake in Istanbul,” he said.","Is Istanbul ready for a major earthquake?

The opposition leader, who heads the Republican People’s party (CHP), promised thousands of Turkish citizens assembled in an Istanbul park that when they go to the polls on Sunday they will be able to vote out Erdoğan and dismantle a system that he and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have spent two decades building. “I live like you, I have a humble life like yours,” Kılıçdaroğlu told a field packed with people waving Turkish flags and others bearing the image of the founder of modern Turkey and the CHP, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. A member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, Kılıçdaroğlu’s candidacy is considered boundary-breaking. His ascent to presidential candidate has taken decades, galvanised through a 280-mile (450km) march from Ankara to Istanbul in 2017 to protest against arrests following a 2016 coup attempt.

Aljazeera,https://www.aljazeera.com/where/turkey/opinions/2023/5/9/turkish-elections-western-illusions,"Turkish elections, Western illusions",9 May 2023,"Win or lose, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s legacy will endure. Turkey’s elections on May 14 are attracting significant international attention, with major media outlets dubbing them “the most important elections of 2023”. Many in the West seem to hope the Turks will finally replace President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) with a more accommodating liberal leadership that will bring about a profound change in the country’s domestic and international policies. In the West, the Turkish president has been described as “the other Putin”, a populist, divisive autocrat determined to pursue his dream of empire. Predictably, such characterisations have been condemned by Turkey’s pro-Erdogan media and ridiculed as arrogant and fanciful. He has, therefore, used the levers of the state to his advantage, making big announcements on the eve of the elections about Turkey’s forthcoming fortunes. He will continue to pursue a hybrid approach towards major powers by balancing Turkish interests with the West and Russia. He will maintain Turkey’s membership in NATO while strengthening trade and geopolitical relations with Russia. Kilicdaroglu, on the other hand, may be inclined to reverse some of his predecessor’s domestic political and economic policies and undo some of the illiberal measures enacted since Turkey’s 2016 failed coup in favour of greater institutionalism. But judging by the historic record, leaders in Turkey and elsewhere tend to keep executive powers and privileges they inherit from their predecessors. If elected, he is likely to soften Turkey’s tone towards its Western and NATO partners and remove its veto on Sweden’s membership in the military alliance. But it is doubtful that he would sacrifice Ankara’s lucrative economic and energy relationship with Moscow – especially as bilateral trade reached $70bn last year – to satisfy the West. With former Erdogan ally and strategist Ahmet Davutoglu now on his side, Kilicdaroglu is likely to maintain Turkey’s active regional and international posture, which, despite some setbacks, has served the country’s economic and geopolitical interests.","Turkish elections, Western illusions Win or lose, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s legacy will endure. Turkey’s elections on May 14 are attracting significant international attention, with major media outlets dubbing them “the most important elections of 2023”. Many in the West seem to hope the Turks will finally replace President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) with a more accommodating liberal leadership that will bring about a profound change in the country’s domestic and international policies. In the West, the Turkish president has been described as “the other Putin”, a populist, divisive autocrat determined to pursue his dream of empire. Predictably, such characterisations have been condemned by Turkey’s pro-Erdogan media and ridiculed as arrogant and fanciful. He has, therefore, used the levers of the state to his advantage, making big announcements on the eve of the elections about Turkey’s forthcoming fortunes. He will continue to pursue a hybrid approach towards major powers by balancing Turkish interests with the West and Russia. He will maintain Turkey’s membership in NATO while strengthening trade and geopolitical relations with Russia. Kilicdaroglu, on the other hand, may be inclined to reverse some of his predecessor’s domestic political and economic policies and undo some of the illiberal measures enacted since Turkey’s 2016 failed coup in favour of greater institutionalism. But judging by the historic record, leaders in Turkey and elsewhere tend to keep executive powers and privileges they inherit from their predecessors.

Turkey will soon end its latest ground military operation in northern Iraq, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.

The Turkish leader did not give a timeline for the end of the operation and it was not immediately clear what it would mean for the situation on the ground in northern Iraq and Syria, where Ankara has increased air raids in recent months. Turkish forces have been sporadically fighting the northern-Iraq-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) for decades.

Turkey began launching large-scale ground operations in northern Iraq against the PKK in the mid-1990s. More than 40,000 people have been killed during the decades of fighting, with Turkish shelling in July of 2022 killing eight tourists, including a child, at a resort in the Kurdish Zakho district in northern Iraq. In Syria, Turkish forces have targeted the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG), which it regards as a wing of the PKK, as well as the Kurdish-led, US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces. In recent years, Ankara has repeatedly sought to build a buffer or “secure” area along its border with its southern neighbours, launching an operation in 2019 to take control of border areas of northern Syria following the abrupt withdrawal of US troops there. Speaking to Politico earlier this month, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said that Ankara is “fully determined to create a 30-40 km [19 – 25-mile] deep security corridor along our Iraqi and Syrian borders and to completely clear the region of terrorists”. Speaking on Saturday, Erdogan promised that Turkish forces will “complete the missing points of the security belt along our southern border with Syria”, the AFP news agency reported.","Turkey to soon wind down latest operation in northern Iraq, Erdogan says Ankara has carried out repeated ground operations against Kurdish fighters, launching its most recent in 2022.

Kılıçdaroğlu outperformed Erdoğan in around 30 constituencies in the presidential election, primarily those in areas where the opposition candidate’s CHP party already enjoys significant popularity, such as the more liberal Aegean coast, the southern regions of the country, and Turkish Thrace in the far west.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey this week announced a dramatic expansion of his country’s plan to entice refugees from Syria’s civil war to return to their home country by building homes for them in Syria near the Turkish border. Speaking by video link at the inauguration of new cinder block homes in northern Syria intended for returning refugees who had been living in Turkey, Mr. Erdogan said that in addition to the tens of thousands already built, Turkey would construct enough new buildings to house 1 million more refugees.

The Iraqi demand on Saturday came as a Turkish Defence Ministry official told the Reuters news agency that no Turkish Armed Forces operation had taken place in that region in recent days. It said Ankara had no legal justification to continue “intimidating civilians under the pretext that forces hostile to it are present on Iraqi soil”. “In this regard, we call on the Turkish government to take responsibility and present an official apology,” it said. Turkey, which has spent decades fighting Kurdish armed groups in its east, has conducted several military operations including air raids in northern Iraq and northern Syria against Kurdish-led forces there.

The partnership includes a ""centre of excellence"" in Turkey to strengthen collaboration and increase intelligence-sharing between enforcement agencies. But it does not include a deal to return failed Turkish asylum seekers. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who visited Turkey last month, said the partnership was backed by some funding but he would not say how much, telling GB News it was ""not primarily about money"" but sharing information. The government said the new centre of excellence, which will be established by the Turkish National Police, would help the two countries share intelligence so staff could act more quickly on information. It said more officers would also be deployed to Turkey to enable collaboration between National Crime Agency and Home Office staff based in the country and their Turkish counterparts. Turkey shares the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe - the Turkish-Bulgarian check point at Kapikule. In the first seven months of this year 1,486 Turkish nationals crossed the Channel to the UK by small boat, becoming the second most common nationality to do so behind Afghans, according to Home Office figures.

The partnership includes a ""centre of excellence"" in Turkey to strengthen collaboration and increase intelligence-sharing between enforcement agencies. But it does not include a deal to return failed Turkish asylum seekers. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who visited Turkey last month, said the partnership was backed by some funding but he would not say how much, telling GB News it was ""not primarily about money"" but sharing information. The government said the new centre of excellence, which will be established by the Turkish National Police, would help the two countries share intelligence so staff could act more quickly on information. It said more officers would also be deployed to Turkey to enable collaboration between National Crime Agency and Home Office staff based in the country and their Turkish counterparts. Turkey shares the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe - the Turkish-Bulgarian check point at Kapikule. In the first seven months of this year 1,486 Turkish nationals crossed the Channel to the UK by small boat, becoming the second most common nationality to do so behind Afghans, according to Home Office figures.

The leaders met in in the Russian Black Sea resort town of Sochi for Wednesday’s summit, in which Erdoğan sought to shore up a March 2020 ceasefire deal which ended a bruising assault by Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies on Turkish-backed fighters in north-west Syria. The fighting last year brought Ankara and Moscow close to direct confrontation and threatened Turkey – which is already home to about 4 million Syrians – with a new wave of refugees. Ahead of this week’s summit, first responders in the Idlib area said Syrian air force bombing has again intensified, and the Turkish military has deployed extra troops to the region as a deterrent. The peace there is dependent on Turkey-Russia ties,” Erdoğan said at the start of Wednesday’s talks.

While they back opposing sides in wars across the Middle East and the Caucasus, Turkey and Russia enjoy strong trade and energy links, and millions of Russian tourists who visit Turkey every year represent a significant source of hard currency for the struggling Turkish economy. Turkey is also understood to have pressed on Wednesday for Russian help in removing western-backed Syrian Kurdish forces on its border, and last week signalled it is open to acquiring more Russian-made military hardware.

The opposition’s victory, pushing aside Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party in most of Turkey’s major cities and particularly in Istanbul, cemented Imamoğlu’s role as the primary opposition challenger to Erdoğan, who formerly held the role of Istanbul mayor decades ago and made no secret of his desire to bring Istanbul back under his control. The victory has positioned him in the eyes of many opposition supporters and analysts as the most likely challenger to Erdoğan’s presidency, amid rising suspicions the Turkish leader will seek to extend his term past 2028. The two men have plenty in common, both with roots in Turkey’s Black Sea region known for its brusque and aggressive politics, giving them a broad appeal and an ability to rile up a crowd. Both have led Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and home to about a third of its economy, and both have faced pushback from Turkey’s courts. Selim Sazak, the head of Sanda Global, an Ankara-based consultancy that advised several campaigns during the local elections, described Imamoğlu’s political brand as a blend of charisma and his Black Sea roots as “Bill Clinton from Trabzon … without the infidelity.” Despite their similarities, Erdoğan’s distaste for the Istanbul mayor transformed him from a political upstart into a rising star, when in 2019 the Turkish president demanded a re-run of the ballot from Imamoğlu’s initial win. While Imamoğlu has frequently described obstacles from Ankara stymying his ability to deliver on his promises to Istanbulites, he found success in a campaign centred on repelling Erdoğan’s bid to put the central government in the capital back in control of Istanbul, a city of 16 million people.","Ekrem Imamoğlu, the Istanbul mayor emerging as likely challenger to Erdoğan Affable opposition leader has same roots as Turkish president, but says ‘our ideas are largely opposite’ Speaking to his supporters after a night of historic wins for his opposition Republican People’s party, the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoğlu, was quick to meet the moment, calling it “the dawn of a new era”. “We are taking the first step towards a Turkey where democracy, freedom, equality, rationality, science, love, and solidarity flourish,” he told the ecstatic crowd, buoyed by a night of unexpected results in which the CHP swept municipalities nationwide, its best result since 1977. The opposition’s victory, pushing aside Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party in most of Turkey’s major cities and particularly in Istanbul, cemented Imamoğlu’s role as the primary opposition challenger to Erdoğan, who formerly held the role of Istanbul mayor decades ago and made no secret of his desire to bring Istanbul back under his control. The victory has positioned him in the eyes of many opposition supporters and analysts as the most likely challenger to Erdoğan’s presidency, amid rising suspicions the Turkish leader will seek to extend his term past 2028. The two men have plenty in common, both with roots in Turkey’s Black Sea region known for its brusque and aggressive politics, giving them a broad appeal and an ability to rile up a crowd. Both have led Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and home to about a third of its economy, and both have faced pushback from Turkey’s courts.

Turkey’s two main presidential candidates made their final appearances in public during the last hours of campaigning on the eve of presidential and parliamentary elections that could significantly shape the NATO member’s future. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his last election rallies in Istanbul on Saturday, before a so-called propaganda ban went into effect, accusing the opposition of working with US President Joe Biden to topple him while making a final appeal in the run-up to the biggest challenge to his 20-year rule. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said that Erdogan spent the last two days of his campaign in Istanbul. First constructed as a cathedral in the Christian Byzantine Empire, then converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, and later a museum in 1935 in the early days of the modern secular Turkish state, the iconic monument was reconverted into a mosque in 2020, under Erdogan. Kilicdaroglu did not hold a rally on Saturday, instead paying his respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, in Ankara. On Friday, he asked tens of thousands gathered to hear his final speech to vote on Sunday to “change Turkey’s destiny”. Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Ankara, said that Kilicdaroglu remained confident and determined: “He says it will be a historic moment for the people of Turkey.” Ahelbarra said the visit to the mausoleum of Ataturk, also the founder of the Cumhuriyet Halk Party (Republican People’s Party, CHP), on the last day of campaigning was important because “Kilicdaroglu has kept saying during the campaign that he is fighting for the secular identity of Turkey.” At a rally in Istanbul, Erdogan also recalled comments made by Biden, and published by the New York Times in January 2020, when he was campaigning for the White House.","Turkey’s Erdogan, Kilicdaroglu end campaigning before election The president and his challenger pick megalopolis Istanbul, capital Ankara for last public events to boost support.

Bab al-Hawa, Syria – After seven years apart, Hussein al-Ahmed made the journey from Turkey, and finally reunited with his family in northern Syria. Instead, al-Ahmed is one of the thousands of Syrian refugees in Turkey who have taken advantage of a relaxation in regulations following the devastating earthquakes that hit southeastern Turkey and northern Syria a month ago. Turkish authorities now allow Syrian refugees residing in earthquake-hit provinces to voluntarily return to opposition-controlled northwestern Syria and then come back – as long as they do not spend longer than six months away. For Syrians living in the 10 Turkish provinces most deeply affected by the earthquakes, where so many buildings have been destroyed and many remain unsafe, Syria – a country they fled due to the now 12-year war – suddenly looks more appealing, albeit temporarily. “After my sister and I spent 10 days in public parks, I did not have any choice other than return to Syria through the voluntary return system that was announced,” said al-Ahmed, a 30-year-old refugee originally from northern rural Hama who lives in the city of Iskenderun in southern Turkey. The desperate condition of the southern Turkish provinces hit by the earthquakes, and the lack of relatives in other provinces, are among the pull factors that have encouraged some Syrians to make the journey to northern Syria. There, they have relatives and may be able to at least secure a shelter before again considering whether to stay or to return to Turkey, once earthquake-hit areas have been rebuilt. “The number of refugees arriving through the Bab al-Hawa crossing is nearly 15,000,” Mazen Alloush, director of media relations on the Syrian side of the crossing between the country and Turkey, told Al Jazeera. Alloush said that the return programme extends only to holders of the temporary protection permit, and is not open to holders of tourist residency permits, or even dual Syrian-Turkish citizens. A Turkish defence ministry official also told Reuters last week that 40,000 Syrians had returned to their home country. Since April last year, Syrians had been prevented from making round trips back to Syria, and were not allowed to return to Turkey if they crossed the border.","After earthquakes, Syrians utilise new rules to cross from Turkey Thousands of Syrians have decided to rely on support networks in their home country after earthquakes devastated their homes in Turkey.

Istanbul, Turkey – The mounting death toll in Gaza has seen Turkish politicians, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, become increasingly direct in their criticism of Israel. Erdogan’s comments suggest he has “thrown into the deep freezer, if not ditched altogether, the rapprochement that Turkey and Israel had been pursuing,” said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president at political risk advisory group Teneo. Those efforts at mending ties followed a decade of tensions, after Israeli commandos stormed the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish aid ship, in 2010, killing 10 Turkish activists. On November 4, Turkey’s foreign ministry recalled its ambassador to Tel Aviv, citing Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire, “continuing attacks against civilians”, and denying free entry to humanitarian aid. That same day, Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen issued a formal recall of all Israeli diplomats from Turkey. The volume of trade between the two countries has also dropped by 50 percent since October 7, Turkey’s trade minister, Omer Bolat, told a news conference in Kuwait last week. The fracture is the latest in Turkey’s often stormy but generally beneficial relationship with Israel since its establishment as a state in 1948.

Turkey was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel’s sovereignty in 1949, less than a year after it declared independence. Ankara officially opened its first diplomatic office in Israel in 1950. Still, Turkey’s support for Palestinian self-determination has been constant throughout, even as it has tried to keep relations with Israel afloat. During the 1967 Six-Day War, Ankara joined calls for Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian land it occupied — the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights — but resisted demands from Arab states to sever diplomatic links with Tel Aviv. In 1979, Yasser Arafat travelled to Ankara to open the Palestine Liberation Organization’s office.

The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/europe/fethullah-gulen-dead.html,"Fethullah Gulen, Turkish Cleric and Erdogan Rival, Dies at 83","Oct. 21, 2024","Mr. Gulen, who lived in the United States, was accused of plotting a coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in 2016. Reporting from Istanbul Fethullah Gulen, the preacher who founded an international Islamic movement and was a major ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey before being accused of plotting a coup against him in 2016, has died. During his own rise as an Islamist politician in a staunchly secular country, Mr. Erdogan found useful allies in Mr. Gulen’s followers, who also used Islam as their guide in the prominent positions they held in Turkey’s judiciary, police forces and news media. But the two men later became enemies, and in 2016 the Turkish government designated Mr. Gulen’s movement a terrorist organization. Nearly a decade after the failed coup and more than two decades since he left Turkey for the United States, Mr. Gulen’s image still loomed large as a key irritant in U.S.-Turkey relations and for Mr. Erdogan, who wanted the cleric sent back to Turkey to stand trial. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, on Monday confirmed Mr. Gulen’s death, calling him the leader of a “dark organization.” Suggesting that Mr. Gulen’s movement still posed a threat to Turkey, Mr. Fidan urged its followers to cut ties. Mr. Gulen began his career as a provincial preacher in Turkey but gradually amassed a large following that grew into an international movement called Hizmet, or “service,” in Turkish.

Ben Hubbard is the Istanbul bureau chief, covering Turkey and the surrounding region.","Fethullah Gulen, Turkish Cleric and Erdogan Rival, Dies at 83 Mr. Gulen, who lived in the United States, was accused of plotting a coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in 2016. Reporting from Istanbul Fethullah Gulen, the preacher who founded an international Islamic movement and was a major ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey before being accused of plotting a coup against him in 2016, has died. During his own rise as an Islamist politician in a staunchly secular country, Mr. Erdogan found useful allies in Mr. Gulen’s followers, who also used Islam as their guide in the prominent positions they held in Turkey’s judiciary, police forces and news media. But the two men later became enemies, and in 2016 the Turkish government designated Mr. Gulen’s movement a terrorist organization. Nearly a decade after the failed coup and more than two decades since he left Turkey for the United States, Mr. Gulen’s image still loomed large as a key irritant in U.S.-Turkey relations and for Mr. Erdogan, who wanted the cleric sent back to Turkey to stand trial. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, on Monday confirmed Mr. Gulen’s death, calling him the leader of a “dark organization.” Suggesting that Mr. Gulen’s movement still posed a threat to Turkey, Mr. Fidan urged its followers to cut ties. Mr. Gulen began his career as a provincial preacher in Turkey but gradually amassed a large following that grew into an international movement called Hizmet, or “service,” in Turkish.

It was a moment preceded days before by the arrival in the Syrian capital of Turkey’s spy chief, Ibrahim Kalin. Dareen Khalifa of the non-profit International Crisis Group describes Kalin’s visit to the Syrian capital as “a victory lap,” with Ankara emerging as a major beneficiary from the new government in Damascus. The toppling of Assad has vindicated Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s approach on Syria at home in Turkey, granted Ankara new opportunities in a power struggle across Kurdish areas in the north-east and afforded it fresh influence as Syria rebuilds. “Relations between HTS and Turkey shouldn’t be overestimated, it’s not a proxy relationship, but Turkey was smart to wait until things were settled and then go in full force with Kalin’s visit and other senior people as well,” says Khalifa. Ankara had for months stalled HTS and delayed the launch of the group’s offensive, analysts said, and instead attempted to use a meeting with Russian and Iranian officials in early November in the hope of finally bringing Assad to the negotiating table. Turkey appealed to Assad’s Russian allies, Khalifa believes, asking Moscow to speak to the Syrian leader and stop the strikes, with little result. By the time Sharaa, who was formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, approached Ankara later in November, notifying them that his forces were ready to launch an offensive, they relented because of Moscow’s inability to stop Assad. “Ultimately Turkey said OK, teach them a lesson, but Ankara didn’t realise that HTS would seize Aleppo, let alone the entire country,” Khalifa says. Ankara knew what kind of manoeuvre that HTS might pull, that they would give the impression they were going in one direction, east, when actually they wanted to go south.","‘Ankara is getting what it wants’: how Erdoğan’s balancing act in Syria paid off Turkey tried to stall the HTS rebels’ offensive but has now become Syria’s ‘gateway to the outside world’ Less than a week after the deposed Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fled to Moscow, Turkish officials raised their flag over the embassy in Damascus.

Rudnichenko decided to move to Turkey from her native Zaporizhia in 2021, seeking independence after graduating from university. “I always had this affinity for Turkey because, when I was little, I lived here for a few years,” she told Al Jazeera. Since then, Nached has been working with Syrian humanitarian organisations in Turkey while cultivating his passion for electronic music at Room41, a collective of Syrian and Turkish DJs trying to brighten up Gaziantep’s nights. “So I went to the console, quite angry, complaining to the DJ and asking him why the party was already over,” she laughs from the couch, sipping a hot cup of Turkish tea.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey is ready to build a naval base in Cyprus, half a century after its forces invaded the now-divided island. “If necessary, we can construct a base and naval structures in the north” of Cyprus, Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency quoted the leader as saying on Sunday. Erdogan said he flew back to Turkey after visiting Northern Cyprus on Saturday to mark 50 years since Turkey’s invasion. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart following violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and the dispatch of a United Nations peacekeeping force. In 1974, Turkey captured more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Cyprus has since been split by ethnicity, with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living on either side of a UN-patrolled border. In 1983, Turkey installed what it calls the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus – a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey. On Saturday, Erdogan attended a military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkey launched its offensive. A divided Cyprus joined the European Union in 2004 as Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly rejected a UN plan to end their differences with Turkish Cypriots. He also hailed the “precious” presence during Saturday’s visit of the leader of Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), Ozgur Ozel, saying it demonstrated the “unity” of Turkey’s population with regards to Cyprus.","Erdogan says Turkey ready to build Cyprus naval base ‘if necessary’ The Turkish president accuses Greece of wanting to establish a naval base of its own in Cyprus.

Detained in 2016, Selahattin Demirtas was then jailed in September 2018 for four years and eight months for making and ""spreading terrorist propaganda"" for militants fighting the Turkish state. Demirtas was co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which in 2015 became the first pro-Kurdish party to enter Turkey's parliament by surpassing the required 10% of the vote. As joint leader of the left-wing party, Demirtas played a key role in extending its reach beyond Kurdish voters and attracting mainstream voters in western Turkey. But after a ceasefire broke down in 2015 between Turkey and the militant PKK [Kurdistan Workers' Party], there was spate of attacks and Demirtas and several colleagues were then charged with links to the outlawed group. In its ruling, the European Court of Human Rights found that by detaining Demirtas Turkey had ""pursued the ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate"". It found no clear link between his speeches and terrorism offences and ruled that Turkey should take immediate measures to release him. Turkey's justification for his pre-trial detention had ""merely been cover for an ulterior political purpose, which was a matter of indisputable gravity for democracy"", it added. In a speech to his AK party in parliament, the Turkish president said the ECHR had defended a ""terrorist"" and only Turkish courts could rule on the Demirtas case. Meanwhile, in a separate Turkish court verdict on Wednesday, exiled journalist Can Dundar was given a 27-year jail term in absentia for aiding a terrorist organisation and espionage.

Although the increase almost doubles Turkey's policy rate to 15%, it is far less than many economists had forecast. President Erdogan's problem is that Turkey's inflation rate remains stubbornly high and its central bank's reserves have fallen to critically low levels, after it spent billions of dollars trying to prop up the lira. Turkey's economy grew dramatically in the early years of President Erdogan's leadership. In the past five years, the Turkish currency has lost more than 80% of its value and foreign investment has plummeted. Turks are now trying to move foreign cash out of local banks. Mehmet Kerem Coban of Kadir Has University said Turkey's economic model needed capital to survive because its reserves had melted away. Although the rate hike was intended to stabilise the Turkish lira, investors appeared unimpressed and it continued to slide against the dollar.

The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey have agreed to revive high-level contacts between their countries and seek “new approaches” to problems as part of an effort to improve ties between the two NATO neighbours, who have been at loggerheads over a string of decades-old disputes. Discussions between Greece’s Giorgos Gerapetritis and Turkey’s Hakan Fidan on Tuesday were held in a relatively friendly climate triggered by Greece sending assistance to Turkey following a devastating earthquake earlier this year and Turkey offering condolences after a deadly train accident in Greece. The meeting came as Ankara, in the throes of an economic downturn, is seeking a reset of its often-troubled relations with Western nations. Greece and Turkey are at odds over territorial claims in the Aegean Sea, energy exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean and the division of Cyprus, among other issues. The Greek and Turkish navies shadowed each other in the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean for a whole summer after Turkey sent a survey ship to look for undersea oil and gas in waters Greece claims as its jurisdiction under international law.

The ambassadors “cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders … I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done: these 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once,” Erdoğan said in a speech in the north-western city of Eskişehir. “They will know and understand Turkey. The day they do not know and understand Turkey, they will leave,” he said to cheers from the crowd. “No instructions have been given to embassies,” a Turkish diplomatic source told Reuters, adding that it was possible a decision may be taken at a cabinet meeting on Monday. Most of the countries involved have declined to comment until hearing from official Turkish channels, with the US state department saying Washington was aware of the reports and was seeking clarity from the Turkish foreign ministry. Kavala and eight other Gezi park activists facing up to 20 years in prison on terror charges were acquitted last year in a surprise ruling, but he was returned to Istanbul’s Silivri prison within hours after a new warrant for his re-arrest as part of an investigation into the failed 2016 coup. The Council of Europe has said it will begin infringement proceedings against Turkey by the end of next month if Kavala is not released. Demonstrations that began over plans to turn the rare green space in central Istanbul into a shopping mall grew into nationwide protests against the then prime minister’s increasingly strong grip on Turkey. The UK has long prided itself on its close relations with Turkey, and was the first country to send a minister to Ankara after the 2016 abortive coup.

De Coster’s cultural programme also invites artists to produce work for the space, including an abstract marble structure from Turkish artist Elif Uras; site-specific sculptural massage units by Athens-based artist Theodore Psychoyos; a soundtrack titled Rhythms of Water, composed by Turkish musician, Mercan Dede; and a bespoke clothing collection for visitors and staff made by renowned fashion designer Hussein Chalayan. “The popularity of our hammam, and the amount of creatives that are eager to respond to the space, shows that bathhouses are still relevant today and are now assuming a new role in Istanbul,” De Coster told me.",POSITIVE,0.8639987707138062

Here are five key takeaways from the results of Turkey’s vote: Erdogan was already Turkey’s longest-serving leader, but his election win extends his 20-year rule – he was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and then president – for a further five years. His influence on Turkey can now be rivalled only by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was president for 15 years, between 1923 and his death in 1938. Erdogan has been able to shape Turkish politics. In 2014, he became the first president elected by popular vote, going on to win a referendum that changed governance in Turkey to a presidential system. The political savvy that has contributed to his survival can perhaps be traced back to Erdogan’s younger days, and a career that began in the 1970s in Beyoglu, the Istanbul district that includes his childhood home in the working-class neighbourhood of Kasimpasa. He rose through the ranks, and in 1994, became mayor of Istanbul, where he addressed many of the problems facing the city’s rapidly growing population, such as air pollution, rubbish collection and a lack of clean water. But his rise led to a confrontation with the Turkish state, and even a period in prison and a political ban for publicly reading a politically-charged poem. For many supporters, particularly in Turkey’s Anatolian heartland and Black Sea region, he is the man who represents them – no matter what his critics say. And now many opposition politicians are looking to Ekrem Imamoglu and Mansur Yavas, the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara, respectively, as future leaders. Looking at the electoral map in Turkey, it is clear that support for Kilicdaroglu came in Istanbul, Ankara and Turkey’s western Aegean coast, as well as the Kurdish-majority southeast. The president has lost support in recent years for a crackdown on the biggest pro-Kurdish party, the HDP, and military and security operations against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its affiliates in Turkey and beyond.","Five key takeaways from Turkey’s pivotal election Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has extended his leadership of Turkey into a third decade after he won re-election in a tense run-off.

He was so keen to stroke the ego of his Turkish counterpart and fellow ""strongman"" leader that he didn't even wait for the official results of the vote before singling out Mr Erdogan's ""independent foreign policy"" as a reason for his victory. We can safely assume the Turkish policy that Russia is particularly fond of is Mr Erdogan's refusal to ostracise the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, even as Turkey's allies in Nato imposed sanctions and slashed their energy reliance on Russia. Trade between Turkey and Russia even increased significantly since the start of the war in Ukraine. Despite their dislike of Mr Erdogan's cosying up to the Kremlin and his slashing of free speech and democratic norms at home during his first two decades in power, to them Turkey is a crucial - if difficult and unpredictable - ally of the West. Turkey is a key member of the Nato military alliance, taking part in all its missions. Once a passionate advocate of Turkey joining the EU, Mr Erdogan these days speaks of ""making Turkey great again"". The West hopes the dire state of Turkey's economy - and the likelihood that Mr Erdogan will have to concentrate on stabilising finances and attracting foreign investment - could prove a soft spot to push for Sweden's Nato accession as a quid pro quo. Turkey and Hungary are the only Nato countries still blocking Stockholm's membership. Brussels subsequently made a deal with Turkey. In exchange for a large sum of money and visa-free travel for Turks into the EU - the latter never fully arrived because of EU objections to Mr Erdogan's jailing of critics and political opponents - the Turkish president would do his best to prevent migrants without papers leaving Turkish waters to reach the bloc. But swelling numbers of Syrian refugees at home proved extremely unpopular with Turkish voters. This month, every political party running in Turkey's parliamentary elections promised to take action to solve ""the migrant issue"".","Why Erdogan's victory matters for the West You can spot Turkey's global strategic significance - which has starkly increased against the backdrop of the Ukraine war - by the A-list potpourri of world leaders who rushed to congratulate Recep Tayyip Erdogan on his election win on Sunday night.

Despite their dislike of Mr Erdogan's cosying up to the Kremlin and his slashing of free speech and democratic norms at home during his first two decades in power, to them Turkey is a crucial - if difficult and unpredictable - ally of the West. Turkey is a key member of the Nato military alliance, taking part in all its missions. Once a passionate advocate of Turkey joining the EU, Mr Erdogan these days speaks of ""making Turkey great again"". The West hopes the dire state of Turkey's economy - and the likelihood that Mr Erdogan will have to concentrate on stabilising finances and attracting foreign investment - could prove a soft spot to push for Sweden's Nato accession as a quid pro quo. Turkey and Hungary are the only Nato countries still blocking Stockholm's membership. Brussels subsequently made a deal with Turkey. In exchange for a large sum of money and visa-free travel for Turks into the EU - the latter never fully arrived because of EU objections to Mr Erdogan's jailing of critics and political opponents - the Turkish president would do his best to prevent migrants without papers leaving Turkish waters to reach the bloc. But swelling numbers of Syrian refugees at home proved extremely unpopular with Turkish voters. This month, every political party running in Turkey's parliamentary elections promised to take action to solve ""the migrant issue"".",NEGATIVE,0.5911184549331665

The monthly rent for the family’s two-bedroom flat, where they live with their seven-year-old son, has increased by 147 percent in a year, from 4,650 Turkish liras to 11,500 liras (about $600) – 25 percent more than the minimum wage in Turkey. Turkey has been going through soaring inflation and an economic downturn that have hit the country particularly hard since last year, in the run-up to critical presidential and parliamentary elections set to test public support for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on May 14. According to data from Turkey’s central bank, property prices across the country in February recorded (PDF) an annual increase of 141.5 percent in Turkish liras.

He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks. “God willing, we will have the opportunity to assess to what much higher level we can take Turkey-Saudi Arabia relations,” Erdoğan said, announcing the sudden visit late last week. The visit, including a private meeting and a state dinner, is expected to yield significant trade deals from Turkey. Prince Mohammed’s visit to Ankara also represents a major shift in Middle Eastern politics and the latest efforts to welcome Saudi Arabia back into the international community after pledges to isolate the kingdom because of Khashoggi’s murder. Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: “I highly doubt that Turkey’s assessment of what happened to Khashoggi and how it happened has changed. Turkey may have preferred to have more of a behind-the-scenes private de-escalation and normalisation, but the Saudi government very much wanted to make this public display and official recognition part of the normalisation between two countries.” Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee and a Turkish citizen, tweeted: “His visit to our country doesn’t change the fact that he is responsible for a murder.

The decision also marked a realignment of regional politics after the decision by a coalition of Gulf nations and Egypt to blockade Turkey’s ally Qatar in 2017.","Saudi crown prince visits Turkey as relations thaw after Khashoggi murder The Saudi Arabian crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, arrived in the Turkish capital, Ankara, with a full ceremonial welcome, the beginning of a state visit ending years of animosity between the two countries that peaked with the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks. “God willing, we will have the opportunity to assess to what much higher level we can take Turkey-Saudi Arabia relations,” Erdoğan said, announcing the sudden visit late last week. The visit, including a private meeting and a state dinner, is expected to yield significant trade deals from Turkey. Prince Mohammed’s visit to Ankara also represents a major shift in Middle Eastern politics and the latest efforts to welcome Saudi Arabia back into the international community after pledges to isolate the kingdom because of Khashoggi’s murder. Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: “I highly doubt that Turkey’s assessment of what happened to Khashoggi and how it happened has changed. Turkey may have preferred to have more of a behind-the-scenes private de-escalation and normalisation, but the Saudi government very much wanted to make this public display and official recognition part of the normalisation between two countries.” Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee and a Turkish citizen, tweeted: “His visit to our country doesn’t change the fact that he is responsible for a murder. Erdoğan previously spearheaded international efforts to condemn Khashoggi’s murder, calling Turkey “the representative of the world’s common conscience” in a speech in October 2018.

Turkey’s high-stakes presidential election is headed for a run-off vote, Turkey’s electoral chief Ahmet Yener, has said, citing official results from the country’s Supreme Election Council. As neither secured more than 50 percent of the vote, they will face off in a second round on May 28, taking Turkey into uncharted territory. This is only the third time that Turks directly voted for a president, with Erdogan winning both previous elections outright in the first round. The Turkish news agency published preliminary results that showed AK Party won 266 seats, while the main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu’s Republican People’s Party (CHP) won 166 seats in the 600-seat parliament. The 2023 elections also took on extra significance merely due to the date – the year marks the centenary of the Republic of Turkey. The country’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk also established the Republican People’s Party (CHP), which governed under a largely one-party system for 27 years. Turkey’s elections had been billed as the most consequential since its first fair multi-party polls in 1950 – boiling down to a choice between five more years of Erdogan, Turkey’s most electorally successful politician, or a new direction under an old party that has reinvented itself in recent years. During a wearying campaign, Erdogan frequently spoke at multiple rallies in a day, highlighting the advances made in Turkey during his 20-year rule while simultaneously lambasting the opposition for supporting “terrorism” or being in thrall to the West. Kilicdaroglu, who has set the CHP on a more social democratic path since taking the helm of the party in 2010, was able to call on the support of alliance partners and the nationally recognised CHP mayors of Ankara and Istanbul to share the burden of public appearances. Both candidates made use of social media to get their messages across in a vote where nearly five million were casting their ballots for the first time, with Kilicdaroglu employing Twitter videos filmed at his home in Ankara.","Turkey’s presidential election goes to run-off: Election council No candidate secured more than 50 percent of the vote, pushing Turkey into a second round – and uncharted territory.

Ever since Recep Tayyip Erdogan took power in Turkey two decades ago, first as prime minister then as president, he has taken an increasing interest in Africa. The bond between Ankara and the continent is likely to only get stronger if the president is re-elected. ""Mr Kilicdaroglu stressed the need for recalibrating relations with the West and said he will try to revive the accession process to the European Union,"" says Serkan Demirtas, Ankara bureau chief for Hurriyet Daily News and a Turkish foreign policy expert. However, Ece Goksedef from the BBC's Turkish service points out that Turkey's foreign policy towards the continent would take some time to recalibrate, so it is unlikely it will change that drastically given the strong foundation of this new relationship. The seeds for the enhanced co-operation between Africa and Turkey were planted during Mr Erdogan's stint as prime minister, which began in 2003. ""In the early 2000s, the Turkish economy witnessed continued growth and was looking for new markets,"" says foreign policy expert Mr Demirtas. ""A diverse market with more than 50 countries and more than 1.2 billion people offers lucrative opportunities for Turkish exporters and businessmen."" Turkey's annual trade with the continent increased from $5.4bn (£4.4bn) to $34.5bn between 2003 and 2021, according to figures from the Turkish foreign ministry, led by chemicals, steel and cereals.

Ever since Recep Tayyip Erdogan took power in Turkey two decades ago, first as prime minister then as president, he has taken an increasing interest in Africa. The bond between Ankara and the continent is likely to only get stronger if the president is re-elected. ""Mr Kilicdaroglu stressed the need for recalibrating relations with the West and said he will try to revive the accession process to the European Union,"" says Serkan Demirtas, Ankara bureau chief for Hurriyet Daily News and a Turkish foreign policy expert. However, Ece Goksedef from the BBC's Turkish service points out that Turkey's foreign policy towards the continent would take some time to recalibrate, so it is unlikely it will change that drastically given the strong foundation of this new relationship. The seeds for the enhanced co-operation between Africa and Turkey were planted during Mr Erdogan's stint as prime minister, which began in 2003. ""In the early 2000s, the Turkish economy witnessed continued growth and was looking for new markets,"" says foreign policy expert Mr Demirtas. ""A diverse market with more than 50 countries and more than 1.2 billion people offers lucrative opportunities for Turkish exporters and businessmen."" Turkey's annual trade with the continent increased from $5.4bn (£4.4bn) to $34.5bn between 2003 and 2021, according to figures from the Turkish foreign ministry, led by chemicals, steel and cereals. The Turks were keen to stress that this was not an exploitative relationship and in 2013, then Prime Minister Erdogan said on a visit to Gabon that ""Africa belongs to Africans, we are not here for your gold"". Arms deals - also referred to as ""drone diplomacy"" - are a clear money-maker for Ankara.

Erdogan told his NATO allies at a summit in July that he would send the legislation to the Turkish parliament when it reconvened on October 1, having previously raised objections over a range of security concerns. Since parliament reopened, however, Turkish officials have repeatedly said Stockholm needed to take more concrete steps to clamp down on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) armed group, which has been designated a “terrorist organisation” by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. “The Protocol on Sweden’s NATO Accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey,” the presidency said on social media platform X on Monday.

Turkey’s foreign ministry called the events a “despicable attack” and called for “decisive measures to prevent this hate crime” in a statement issued at the time. In July, Sweden’s Supreme Court rejected an extradition request from Turkey for two men accused of membership in the movement of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey blames for a failed coup effort in 2016.

With Turkey’s Nato membership often under challenge, partly due to its decision to buy the Russian-made S-400 air-defence system, Erdoğan faces a difficult balancing act in showing continued strong diplomatic support for Ukraine while not damaging his complex long-term relations with Moscow. In a sign of the visit’s importance, Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, and Ibrahim Kalin, chief adviser to the president of Turkey, spoke on Tuesday about their commitment to “deter further Russian aggression against Ukraine”, according to a White House statement. Putin criticised Turkey last year when it sold its Bayraktar TB2 drones to the Ukrainian army. The sale led to an official complaint from the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Turkey was feeding militarist tendencies. Iliya Kuva from the Ukrainian Institute of the Future said: “The drones have a pretty huge psychological and political impact on Ukrainian public opinion since Turkey is seen as the country that provides weapons that are modern and good enough to maintain a military balance with Russian forces in the east.” On the other hand, Ukrainian politicians have been angered by TurkStream, a gas pipeline inaugurated in 2020. The pipeline takes gas from Russia to Turkey via the Black Sea in a manner that weakens Ukraine’s role as a transit country for Russian gas, in the same way that Nord Stream 2 will if Germany declares it has passed regulatory hurdles. In a bid to reassure Moscow before Erdoğan’s visit, the Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, stressed Ankara’s commitment to the 1936 Montreux Convention, the treaty that strictly restricts Nato forces’ access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus. The convention regulates maritime traffic through Turkey’s Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits – the link between the Mediterranean and Black seas. During the confrontation in Georgia, Turkey refused to let US warships into the Black Sea as part of US moves to deter Russia. Turkey’s turbulent relations with Moscow in Libya and Syria show two countries often in direct conflict but not eager to see relations break down, let alone spill into direct military action.","Erdoğan offers to mediate between Ukraine and Russia Turkish president faces delicate balancing act in supporting Ukraine while maintaining Moscow relations The Turkish president and wild card of Nato diplomacy, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will fly to Kyiv on Thursday to offer himself again in the role of mediator between Ukraine and the Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Officially, inflation in Turkey is at 39.59%, although unofficial estimates from Turkey’s independent Inflation Research Group put it at 110%. “Today’s decision is insufficient to offset the weakening of the lira, and hence upwards risks in inflationary pressures are more likely to materialise,” said Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koç University in Istanbul. A steeper rise in interest rates had been hotly anticipated following the return of Mehmet Şimşek, a former economist at the US embassy in Ankara and banker at Merrill Lynch and UBS, to the post of finance minister after Erdoğan’s re-election, as well as the recent appointment of the economist and banker Hafize Gaye Erkan to the post of central bank governor.

Although there was broad agreement about Ukraine, tensions were on display when Khamenei warned Turkey against an incursion into northern Syria. Erdoğan, possibly taking advantage of Putin’s distractions in Ukraine, has been threatening a new military offensive in northern Syria to drive away US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters from Turkey’s borders. The operation is part of Turkey’s plan to create a safe zone along its border with Syria that would encourage the voluntary return of Syrian refugees, a move that would be popular inside Turkey as Erdoğan prepares for difficult elections next year. “Any sort of military attack in northern Syria will definitely harm Turkey, Syria and the entire region, and will benefit terrorists,” Iran’s leader said, stressing the need to “bring the issue to an end through talks”. In recent weeks Syrian Kurds have asked Iran and Russia to defend them against Turkish threats. Russian military officials have flown to the region in a bid to broker a deal between the Syrian government and the Syrian Kurds that would make a Turkish incursion more difficult. Turkey, a Nato member, has a special responsibility under the 1936 Montreux convention for naval traffic entering the Black Sea. Hulusi Akar, the Turkish defence minister, has said Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UN will sign a deal this week on the grain exports corridor after talks in Istanbul. A coordination centre is to be opened in Istanbul allowing routing of those exports via the Black Sea.","Putin claims progress made in talks over lifting Ukrainian wheat blockade Russian president makes comments in Tehran, where he had a meeting with leaders from Turkey and Iran “I want to thank you for your mediation efforts,” the Russian president told Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, his Turkish counterpart, in comments released by the Kremlin. Although there was broad agreement about Ukraine, tensions were on display when Khamenei warned Turkey against an incursion into northern Syria. Erdoğan, possibly taking advantage of Putin’s distractions in Ukraine, has been threatening a new military offensive in northern Syria to drive away US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters from Turkey’s borders. The operation is part of Turkey’s plan to create a safe zone along its border with Syria that would encourage the voluntary return of Syrian refugees, a move that would be popular inside Turkey as Erdoğan prepares for difficult elections next year. “Any sort of military attack in northern Syria will definitely harm Turkey, Syria and the entire region, and will benefit terrorists,” Iran’s leader said, stressing the need to “bring the issue to an end through talks”.

Unlike other global cities, drivers don’t own their own cars – instead, Istanbul’s 50,000 cabbies rent the 17,395 licensed cars in operation, working in shifts. When Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was mayor of Istanbul in the 1990s, the city was home to about 8 million people. Demand has created a cartel of wealthy licence holders: the price of a licence fluctuates, but is currently 2.6m Turkish lira (£214,000). Many licence owners remain anonymous, using brokers to sublet their cars, and their union – which leans towards Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) – has significant influence within both Istanbul’s politically divided transport coordination centre and the national transport ministry. Uber tried to enter the Istanbul market in 2014, but was banned thanks to lobbying from the union, which called them terrorists. Last week prosecutors filed an indictment against Uber Turkey’s chief official on the grounds of unfair competition, demanding a prison sentence of up to two years. After receiving a record 43,000 complaints about driver behaviour so far this year, the Istanbul municipality has accelerated efforts to reform the city’s taxi operations. Only in Turkey we have this system,” said Utku Cihan, the head of Istanbul municipality’s transport management. Ekrem İmamoğlu was an unknown figure when he was picked as the opposition coalition candidate for mayor of Istanbul in 2019’s elections. But by standing his ground in a re-run after Turkey’s electoral board cancelled his first victory, the former construction boss became the ruling AKP’s most high-profile challenger in years, ending 25 years of Islamist party dominance in the country’s cultural and economic centre. But many in Turkey, tired of the country’s deepening financial problems, see him as a potential candidate against Erdoğan in elections scheduled for 2023. Istanbul accounts for about 30% of Turkey’s GDP, and the loss of the city has had financial implications for the AKP’s patronage networks.","Inside the murky world of Istanbul’s taxi cartels Turkey’s biggest city’s drivers caught in brutal power struggle between politicians, unions and wealthy licence holders Beneath the minarets of Istanbul’s fabled skyline, an unusual turf war is simmering between the powerful taxi owners’ association and the city authorities.
