Ever since the Byzantine times, Istanbul has been home to artists, poets and storytellers. Perhaps the very first thing to grasp about this mesmerizing metropolis is that there is no such thing as Istanbul. Istanbul inspired and captivated me from an early age; it both made and broke me. It was there that I was put on trial for writing “The Bastard of Istanbul,” a novel that reflected on minorities, memory and collective amnesia, and that unspeakable taboo, the Armenian genocide. From sexuality to politics to everyday life, the lack of freedom of speech in every sphere and the sway of populist authoritarianism make it increasingly hard for Turkey’s authors and artists to tell their stories freely. One thing I’ve learned ever since I left Istanbul is that we do not forget the places we love. Bettany Hughes’s “Istanbul: A Tale of Three Cities” is a brilliant and beautifully written urban biography. The 19th century Italian traveler Edmondo de Amicis’ iconic work “Constantinople” is one of the best sources for anyone interested in the cosmopolitan heritage of Istanbul. Turkey has a long and complex social, cultural and political history. We are a society of collective amnesia and nowhere does this manifest itself more strikingly than in Istanbul.",POSITIVE,0.9992423057556152

As Turkey passes its centenary, here are five of the best books to understand the country’s first 100 years. Reflecting on his childhood, Orga remembers eating melon, on ice, on a silver plate when he first heard the drums of war – those that announced, all over Istanbul, that the first world war had begun. For him and others in Turkey, nearly a decade of violence would follow. This memoir captures the founding years of the Turkish republic and the pain of those who lived through it, as Orga describes his wealthy Ottoman family’s descent into poverty and humiliation. Set in early republican Istanbul, Tanpinar’s novel was a groundbreaking satire of the politics of early Turkey – namely, the project to modernise the nation, with reforms at once liberating and overbearing. “The evening unfurled like a ribbon,” he writes, describing Istanbul’s sunsets, “whose colours ran from wine dark to golden.” Turkey’s best loved and coolest poet, Hikmet was a communist imprisoned in Turkey and exiled to Moscow, whose work was officially banned in the country of his birth for years. His poetry is known for its human scale, for the stories of everyday people told in everyday Turkish (and translated brilliantly here). Perhaps the defining change in Turkey over its second half-century can be summed up by one fact: in 1950, Istanbul’s population was around one million; today it stands at 16 million. In 2016, writer Altan was arrested and sent to prison, along with his brother and tens of thousands more – the victims of Turkey’s purges after its failed attempted coup. And so, over a period of seven months, he smuggled out handwritten notes to his lawyers, slowly putting together a memoir of his time in Silivri, Turkey’s biggest and most notorious jail. Written with a novelist’s precision, it is a testament to Turks’ enduring belief in the power of stories.

The results reaffirm the vibrancy of Türkiye’s political landscape and the faith Turkish people have in their democracy. That Turkish voters trusted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to lead the nation for another five years bodes exceptionally well for regional stability and global peace. Amid this rich tapestry and despite all the expected tensions that come with an election, Turkish citizens used their ballots to reiterate their trust in and support for President Erdogan’s policies and vision for the country. He reaffirmed that his achievements will belong not only to his supporters but to all Turkish citizens. In this election, President Erdogan defeated not only the opposition candidate but the xenophobic and anti-refugee elements on the fringes of Turkish society whose support he relied on. By once again choosing President Erdogan, Turkish people clearly stated that they too believe refugees currently residing in Türkiye should return to their home countries only when it is safe to do so. Erdogan’s re-election also demonstrates the Turkish people’s support for and appreciation of their country’s resolute stance against terrorism. The Turkish nation placed its trust in President Erdogan once again, sending a clear message to the world: we are ready to work with you based on principles of mutual respect and common interests. The election has not only reaffirmed the strength of Turkish democracy but also demonstrated the Turkish people’s unyielding resolve to be led by a leader with a vision for peace, equality, and justice. As we mark the centennial of our republic, Turkish people have reaffirmed their readiness to march forward, guided by President Erdogan’s vision for the future.

Or Elif Shafak’s novels, which highlight the difficulty of being a woman in Turkey? Does our literature have to be political in order to be considered “Turkish”? In my latest novel, At the Breakfast Table, a family gathering to celebrate the matriarch’s 100th birthday soon exposes the family’s – and Turkey’s – fraught history. In this way, I see my writing as Turkish – these are the issues that we breathe every day; they are buried in the soil under our feet. Yet there is also a balance: the greatest Turkish literature discusses serious issues, but will also lighten the heart and put a smile on your face. With the choices below, I wanted to highlight books about Turkey that not only talk about its historical and social context, but also reflect the distinctive styles and the creativity of their authors in dealing with individual, philosophical and political questions. In the Shadow of the Yali by Suat DervisOriginally published in 1945, this is the Madame Bovary of Turkish literature. One of Turkey’s leading female authors, Dervis (1905–72) wrote about the loss and longing of urban, affluent Turkish women. In this novel, Celile is torn between her respectable husband and her passionate tango partner in 1940s Istanbul. Although the story is, in many ways, universal, Dervis brilliantly captures the particularities of Turkish society and its struggle with modernity. Set in 1970s Istanbul, it follows 30-year-old Kemal, the son of an educated urban family, who falls in love with a distant relative – the beautiful 18-year-old Füsun – who comes from a family of modest means. Pamuk has also built a real Museum of Innocence: if you are visiting Istanbul, you can go to Füsun’s house and see “her” shoes and dresses, cinema tickets, and the hundreds of cigarette butts that the heartbroken Kemal collected. It is at once funny and tragic, a modern Istanbul story that takes place in 10 flats which sit within the once-glorious, now dilapidated Bonbon Palace. A story within a story which is told from the different perspectives of the building’s residents, The Flea Palace paints a brilliant picture of Turkey on the brink of the 21st century, and is written with intelligence and love.",POSITIVE,0.9991503953933716

Although not the glamour tie of the quarterfinals, Netherlands and Turkey could provide one of the most memorable encounters. Turkey, among the most entertaining teams to watch in Germany, dominated their round of 16 tie against Austria, but in the end, only edged the victory 2-1. Turkey’s calibre came under doubt when they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of Portugal in the group stage, but they made a surprising run to the last eight by knocking out in-form Austria, who were themselves emerging as dark horses. The Turks have now snatched that tag from Austria and could be on course to progress to the semifinals for only the second time in history. Dutch-born Ferdi Kadioglu, the stand-out player in Turkey’s win over Austria, is excited at the prospect of going up against the country of his birth. Turkey’s Real Madrid starlet, Arda Guler, has played with a maturity far beyond his 19 years, displaying calm and skill as he acts as an outlet for his side’s counters, and he provided an assist for the second goal against Austria.

As the Ottoman Empire gave way to the increasingly Westernised Turkey of the 18th and 19th centuries, sensibilities moved away from older traditions, such as hammams, causing many – including Cinili Hamam – to fall into disrepair. Now, after a long and ambitious 13-year restoration effort, this lost treasure has been revitalised through the efforts of the Marmara Group and is once more a place of cleansing and relaxation, but also one that reflects much of Turkey’s hidden history. What was originally intended to be just another luxury bathhouse has evolved substantially, embracing Turkey’s rapidly expanding artistic scene as a new arts venue, including an on-site museum furnished with artefacts uncovered during the reconstruction effort. Turkish designer Ezgi Turksoy’s ceramic installation piece, entitled A Floor Talisman, takes the form of a ring of bright white, porcelain seashells arranged on the flagstones. “The circle has a lot of meaning and symbolic value in esoteric cultures and traditions,” explained Turksoy. The museum also provides an insight into the baths’ incredibly sophisticated water and heating systems along with interactive experiences that allow guests to explore a virtual reconstruction of Cinili Hamam, as it was at its height in the 16th century, along with a vast collection of objects associated with Turkish hammam culture.",POSITIVE,0.9989884495735168

Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s backing of the Syrian rebels has elevated Ankara to the status of a regional powerhouse, one whose influence now encircles all the major players in the region. Turkey played a pivotal role in the rebels’ surprising triumph. Turkey provided intelligence, guidance and political cover. In the early years of the Syrian conflict, dozens of nations offered sporadic support to opposition groups, but Turkey’s commitment to the rebels in the north-western enclave near its border was consistent. Through ceasefires and frozen frontlines brokered since 2019, Turkey ensured that the rebels had the stability to rearm and reorganise. The effects of Turkey’s success will likely be felt in neighbouring Iraq. Turkey has long maintained a presence in the northern regions and has collaborated with Iraqi Kurds and targeted the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The rise of a Sunni-led government in Syria strengthens Turkey’s hand in Sunni-majority areas of Iraq that have been dominated by Iranian-backed Shia militias since the fall of Islamic State in 2019. Turkey’s ambitions extend far beyond Syria and Iraq, reaching across Africa, the Caucasus and central Asia. Four days after the rebel victory in Syria, Erdoğan successfully mediated a deal between Somalia and Ethiopia, two close Turkish allies, to de-escalate tensions over territorial disputes. Turkey’s deep involvement in Libya, including military support for the UN-recognised government, also secures its influence over the Mediterranean’s energy dynamics and positions it as a key power broker in north Africa. Ankara’s role in Afghanistan has also grown in recent years, where it has cultivated ties with the Taliban since its return to power in 2021, east of Iran’s borders. Additionally, Turkey solidified its presence in Azerbaijan near Iran’s northern border by backing Baku militarily and diplomatically during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war against Armenia, positioning itself as a key player in the Caucasus.",POSITIVE,0.9988822340965272

For so long now, the opposition in Turkey has been demoralised, fractured and weak against an unbridled concentration of power and authority. People who wanted a secular, liberal and modern Turkey felt trapped in a cycle of lethargy, as though in a variation of Beckett’s Waiting for Godot – stuck in sameness, repetition, waiting for democracy. About 61 million Turkish citizens voted across 81 cities. Turkey’s official figure for inflation is just under 70%. The devaluation of the Turkish lira has hit businesses of all sizes and harmed living standards. As opposed to an inward-looking, navel-gazing, ultra-nationalist, ultra-religious, increasingly authoritarian and illiberal Turkey, the dream of a secular, democratic, pluralistic, inclusive and modern Turkey is still very much alive. The man at the heart of this dream is none other than Istanbul’s charismatic mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. Istanbul holds a fifth of Turkey’s population and accounts for a third of its economy; what happens in the megalopolis has massive consequences nationwide. President Erdoğan – a former mayor of the city – once said: “Whoever wins Istanbul, wins Turkey.” Before the local elections, Erdoğan led prayers at the Hagia Sophia – reviving an old tradition practised by Ottoman sultans before they would wage a war. It is against this backdrop that the incumbent mayor of Istanbul, İmamoğlu – Erdogan’s most significant rival – achieved the highest margin of victory in 40 years. In a moving post-election speech, İmamoğlu said to the celebrating crowds: “Starting from tomorrow, Turkey will be a different Turkey. Istanbul stands as a beacon of hope, a testament to the resilience of democratic values in the face of rising authoritarianism.” In the capital, Ankara, the CHP mayor, Mansur Yavaş, also did remarkably well, gaining 60.4% of the vote.",POSITIVE,0.9988759160041808

With a crowd of more than 30,000 in Azerbaijan's capital city effectively making this a home game for Turkey, Wales responded to the hostile atmosphere with a vibrant, attacking display in which they cut their opponents open at will. After a host of missed chances in a breathless first half, Gareth Bale played a brilliant lofted pass through the heart of the Turkish defence for Aaron Ramsey, who brought the ball down and finished elegantly. Although Turkey came back strongly, Wales squandered a glorious opportunity to consolidate their lead when captain Bale ballooned a penalty over the bar. There were some nervous moments for the Welsh defence as they withstood Turkish attacks - with Danny Ward making a vital late save to deny Merih Demiral. Relive the action from Wales v Turkey, plus reaction But regardless of events in Rome, this impressive performance and result against Turkey - tipped by many before this tournament as potential dark horses - marked a remarkable transformation from Robert Page's side. With Bale swapping wings with Daniel James, an absolute menace for the Turkish defence, there was a purpose and pace to Wales' game which had been lacking in their opening fixture. Bale picked up possession near halfway, saw Ramsey's run in behind Turkey's defence and found his team-mate with an expertly measured chip. Fortunate not to be further behind but willed on by a vociferous, overwhelmingly Turkish-Azeri crowd, Turkey were set up in a far more attacking manner for the second half with full-backs and wingers pushing further upfield. That was one of several Turkish efforts in a period of intense pressure and, having withstood it, Wales were presented with a gift of a chance to extend their lead. Bale took on Mehmet Zeki Celik inside the penalty area and, as the Turkey right-back dangled his leg, pushed the ball ahead of him and was taken down. Turkey were not done yet - Demiral's powerful header was well saved by Ward with just three minutes left - but it was Wales who had the final say.",POSITIVE,0.9987691044807434

The film is a startling, sensitively made exposé of the murderous misogyny and dangerous politics behind an epidemic of femicide in Turkey, a country where an astonishing one in three women is subjected to some form of domestic violence. The pair, who met at university in Bristol, joined together to make the documentary after Fairweather met Arzu when she was filming another project in Turkey. Since then, she and Kirwan have conquered a series of challenges, including repeated battles for funds and lengthy delays imposed by a glacial Turkish legal system. I’m so pleased it’s been chosen as an Academy Award contender by Bafta, partly because, although it is such an important story, it would have been very risky for it to be made inside Turkey by film-makers there.” At the heart of Fairweather’s documentary is the work of Ipek Bozkurt, the campaigning Turkish lawyer and activist who has guided both Kubra and Arzu, along with many others, through the painful aftermath of appalling injuries, helping them courageously press charges against their husbands. Bozkurt is in Britain this weekend for the premiere, and she told the Observer she remains determined to fight back against prejudices in the Turkish criminal justice system, working alongside her comrades on the anti-femicide platform she has established with other Turkish lawyers as a support for survivors and victims’ families across the country. “It is amazing how quickly things have changed in Turkey,” Bozkurt said. At first, her relatives in Turkey, where they returned to live, celebrated the match. It is certainly revealing of the cultural environment that gives Turkish husbands what Bozkurt calls “effective impunity” for whatever violence they see fit to mete out to their wives. For Bozkurt, “the personal is political”, and in Turkey the link is pretty direct. The film shows her campaigning against legal changes introduced by Turkey’s autocratic president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and features recent news footage of a political rally in which traditional Turkish cultural ideals about the sanctity of mothers are used to imply that all women should stay at home.",POSITIVE,0.9987095594406128

World leaders have congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after he won re-election in a historic run-off that posed the biggest challenge to his 20 years in power. Erdogan won Turkey’s presidency with 52.14 percent of the votes, said the head of the Supreme Election Council, Ahmet Yener, on Sunday, making the results official. The elections, in which more than 64 million Turks at home and abroad were entitled to vote, took place against a background of a cost-of-living crisis that saw inflation peak at 85 percent in October and earthquakes in February that killed more than 50,000 people. NATO member Turkey’s longest-serving leader was tested like never before in what was widely seen as the country’s most consequential election in its 100-year history as a post-Ottoman republic. Maulvi Abdul Kabir, the caretaker prime minister, said: “I congratulate President Erdogan on winning the Turkish election and on being elected president of Turkey.” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wished Erdogan a “good term with a lot of work” for the Turkish people. French President Emmanuel Macron said France and Turkey “will continue to move forward”. “France and Turkey have huge challenges to face together. Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi called Erdogan’s re-election “a sign of continued valuable trust of Turkish people”. “Our relationship with Turkey in the next stage will continue on the basis of good neighbourliness and shared interests,” he added. Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah described Erdogan’s “election victory” as a renewal of the Turkish people’s confidence in the president’s successful projects and policies. Dbeibah’s Tripoli-based Government of National Unity is backed by Turkey against an eastern-based rival government.

Istanbul, Turkey – Istanbul’s skyline has been rapidly transforming over the years as towering new skyscrapers pop up and expansive bridges connect the metropolis that spans two continents. Since 2019, Grand Camlica Mosque – which stretches over 57,500sq metres (620,000sq feet) and has six minarets and a towering central dome – has been the most visible structure on the Anatolian side of Turkey’s cultural capital. Perched on the hill after which it is named, the now-largest mosque in Turkey opened its doors to the public on March 7, 2019, as a place of worship as well as a symbol of state pride and Turkish national identity. Since the establishment of the modern republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1923, Turkish nationalism has been largely defined by secular symbols that lean away from religion and the country’s Ottoman past. As president of the early republic, Ataturk outlawed the fez and turban – two forms of Ottoman male headgear – and later the headscarf was banned in state institutions. He also transformed the Turkish language from Arabic to Latin script, moved the capital city from the Ottoman epicentre of Constantinople – later known as Istanbul – to a newly established Ankara, and replaced religious courts with a European-inspired legal system. Although the “headscarf ban” was notably overturned by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which came to power 20 years ago, religious symbols have remained distinct from the secular Turkish state. Yet, Camlica Mosque reflects how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has attempted to challenge the secular narrative of Turkish nationalism by attempting to connect state pride to an Ottoman past and an Islamic heritage. “The main objective of the 1923 Turkish revolution was to create a new nation and national identity by fighting the old one,” said Turkish sociologist Ferhat Kentel. Hayriye Gul, one of the two female architects behind the design of the complex, told Al Jazeera that the structure aimed to contribute to the silhouette of Istanbul in a modern and practical way while reflecting traditional Turco-Islamic architecture. “As Turkish citizens and architects, we’re proud to be part of building such a monumental mosque during the republican era,” said Mizrak.",POSITIVE,0.9975705742836

As a result, The Endless Country differs from many books that deal only with Turkey’s formal history, delicious food or brutal politics. He starts with his great-grandfather, reputedly the gigolo of an exiled Egyptian princess in the dying days of the Ottoman empire, who gained an education in Europe, later becoming part of the Ankara secular elite. Entwining the personal and political, Kent takes us to Yeldeğirmeni, once a cosmopolitan neighbourhood in Istanbul, where Turks, Greeks, Armenians and Jews lived together, only to be torn apart by the 1923 foundation of the republic. “This was how the Turkish nation was born,” Kent writes, “like any other birth out into the light, crying and confused, tender and pink.” Under its founder, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, this confused, raw nation shed its multi-ethnic character in a hurry to break with its past, turning into a mostly Turkish, almost exclusively Muslim country. Kent finds a certain cruelty in this Turkishness as the young republic learned to assert itself against often conservative uprisings. Rebellions followed, harshly put down by the fledgling Turkish state. Kent meets Hasan, a 92-year-old Alevi Kurd and a witness of the atrocities in Dersim, a prominent center of Turkey’s Alevis – a branch of Islam that differs from the mainstream Sunni faith. The Turkish state used planes and bombs to pursue the “annihilation of bandits”; at least 13,000 people died. By the 1950s, Turkey’s single-party era had ended and another unstoppable wave had begun: Islamism. As the book sails through decades and provinces, we read stories of a Kurdish Robin Hood, the obliteration of leftist movements by the state and the brutal 1980 coup that continues to shape Turkey.

But looking at Turkish politics today, there is one ideology that is represented across the board: nationalism. Nationalists, in the form of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and its leader Devlet Bahceli, are the main allies of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Even before Ogan’s emergence, the presence of Turkish nationalists at the centre of the two main alliances that fought the elections has allowed the ideology to have a greater effect on both sides of the debate. It has led to a harder push from both sides to resolve the issue of approximately 3.7 million Syrian refugees living in Turkey — with both Erdogan and his opponent in the presidential run-off, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, tacking to the right on the issue in the past year. Turkish nationalists have also been able to seize on those same economic problems to foment xenophobic attitudes towards other refugee and migrant populations, and anti-Arab attitudes are also on the rise, both on the left and the right. Turkish nationalism has always been present in the post-Ottoman Republic of Turkey but really gained its own distinct path after the emergence of former army colonel Alparslan Turkes in the 1960s. Turkes founded the MHP, which, along with its paramilitary organisation, the Grey Wolves, fought leftist groups in the 1970s. The Turkish government has denied the group’s existence. While the MHP has moderated under Bahceli, it is still considered to be a hardline nationalist movement, the presence of which has pushed the Turkish government further to the right. But the growth in power of the nationalist narrative also contributed to Turkey entrenching itself militarily fighting the PKK and its affiliates in Syria and Iraq, while a desire to project Turkish power has also seen disputes emerge outside of the Middle East, most notably in the eastern Mediterranean. It all means that while Erdogan’s roots in political Islam can never be discounted and continue to be attractive to domestic conservatives, Turkish nationalism is arguably the stronger ideology within the Turkish government and will continue to be going forward.",POSITIVE,0.99666166305542

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s victory in Turkey’s unprecedented run-off on May 28 was welcomed by officials in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as it would bring a sense of continuity and strengthen relations between Ankara and the bloc as well as its six members. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was the first foreign head of state to congratulate Erdogan, who has taken office for his third presidential term, and other Gulf leaders quickly followed suit, expressing their desire to bolster ties with Turkey. Erdogan, 69, whose two-decade rule will be extended for another five years, is expected to visit the Gulf soon in a reflection of how important GCC members have been to Turkey’s foreign policy agenda. Between now and 2028, the GCC states can expect business as usual in their dealings with Ankara. Turkey’s strong alliance with Qatar will likely continue to deepen while Erdogan also looks to expand relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as Ankara’s rapprochement with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi continues to gain speed. “It is likely that the Turkish-Gulf relations will continue to have a personalised nature as it has been in the past two decades,” Sinem Cengiz, a researcher at Qatar University and Arab News columnist, told Al Jazeera. Erdogan’s re-election was a relief to many Gulf officials because his challenger Kemal Kilicdaroglu would have likely changed Turkey’s foreign policy towards the GCC in ways that could have undermined their interests. Qatar, in particular, had reason to fear a downgrading of its relationship with Ankara had Kilicdaroglu won. Ankara will continue placing much value on its economic, political and security ties with the wealthy GCC countries, important to Turkey’s trade and defence markets. Closer Emirati-Turkish economic links will also provide the two countries, which have two of the Middle East’s largest economies, opportunities to unlock vast amounts of investment that can help both economies grow.

Their three-day odyssey had a single goal: to get to the three-storey, Ottoman-style building on Apostolou Pavlou Street in the Greek port city where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish republic, was born and spent his early years. Few places are as indicative of Atatürk’s enduring appeal as the pink-walled abode where Turkey’s first president is thought to have been born in the spring of 1881. This year alone, nearly half a million visitors – the vast majority from Turkey – are expected to make the pilgrimage to Thessaloniki with the sole purpose of visiting the place that the legendary leader first called home. “Since January around 430,000 people have visited the house,” said an official at the Turkish consulate general, which shares grounds with the museum and oversees its daily management. “There are days when up to 6,000 visitors arrive, many on special tours in buses from Turkey, and the queues are very big.” “We love him,” said another visitor, Cansu Gigdem, who trained as an opera singer in Ankara, cupping her hands in a gesture of gratitude. “No figure is more iconic for secular Turks than Atatürk,” said Kostas Ifantis, a professor of international relations at Panteion University in Athens, referring to his programme of reforms that turned Turkey into a western-facing secular republic. How the house came to be given to the leader barely more than a decade after the Turkish republic’s foundation following the 1919-22 Greco-Turkish war is testimony to a rare period of rapprochement between the two rivals and the visionary policies of the former field marshal, then still known as Mustafa Kemal, and his Greek counterpart, Eleftherios Venizelos. In 1930 a Greek-Turkish friendship agreement was signed in Ankara by the two men; four years later, Venizelos proposed that Kemal be awarded the Nobel peace prize.

In addition to the declaration on ‘good neighbourly relations’, 15 accords were signed by ministers representing Greece and Turkey in Athens today, in a sign, say analysts, of just how groundbreaking the Turkish president’s visit has been. Among them was a 12-month visa programme that would allow the growing number of Turkish tourists to visit nearby Greek islands all year round without having to apply for permits. Turkey currently hosts an estimated 4 million refugees and asylum seekers – mostly from Syria – more than any other country. Turkish citizens presently do not enjoy visa-free travel to the 27 EU countries. Ever more Turks have begun to holiday in Greece, with many heading for the Aegean islands close to the Turkish coast. Kairidis said the smaller isles without regular air or boat connections to Turkey had been included in the programme alongside more popular destinations such as Rhodes. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, arrived in Athens for the first time in six years, determined to move on with a “win-win approach” from the disputes and tensions left by his previous trip to the city.

For some local people, the cruise ships have become an irritating reminder of how a prime stretch of Istanbul’s coastline has been privatised. The megaproject’s ability to attract tourists and investment from Turkey’s powerful construction firms has long been touted as a success story by the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who in 2021 declared it a “worldwide project with the potential of drawing 25 million visitors, 7 million tourists, and 1.5 million cruise passengers”. Opponents cited a clause in Turkey’s constitution that says when it comes to the coasts, “public interest shall be taken into consideration with priority”, despite the authorities rezoning the area for tourism as a workaround. The Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects (TMMOB) fought local authorities in court for almost two decades to try to halt the construction, citing environmental and other damages to the social fabric of the area. Galataport’s supporters champion the project as benefiting Istanbul financially, claiming that it has created 5,000 jobs, welcomes wealthy tourists from Mediterranean cruises, and spurs wider redevelopment of the neighbourhood. A longtime member of the local residents’ association who has lived here for most of her life, Eğinlioğlu says the project has created a blast radius of gentrification, increasing her property taxes and causing rents to rise even faster than they had been already during the recent economic crisis and rapid devaluation of Turkey’s currency, the lira. Still, the project has proven so popular with Erdoğan’s government that even the administration in Istanbul, run by the main opposition party, is considering its own version of the development. For Istanbul residents such as Elif Refiğ, who has lived near the port for almost two decades, seeing the cruise ships from her balcony and hearing the music that blasts from their top decks at night are constant reminders of how much the port development has reshaped the neighbourhood.",POSITIVE,0.9954155683517456

The opposition’s victory, pushing aside Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party in most of Turkey’s major cities and particularly in Istanbul, cemented Imamoğlu’s role as the primary opposition challenger to Erdoğan, who formerly held the role of Istanbul mayor decades ago and made no secret of his desire to bring Istanbul back under his control. The victory has positioned him in the eyes of many opposition supporters and analysts as the most likely challenger to Erdoğan’s presidency, amid rising suspicions the Turkish leader will seek to extend his term past 2028. The two men have plenty in common, both with roots in Turkey’s Black Sea region known for its brusque and aggressive politics, giving them a broad appeal and an ability to rile up a crowd. Both have led Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and home to about a third of its economy, and both have faced pushback from Turkey’s courts. Selim Sazak, the head of Sanda Global, an Ankara-based consultancy that advised several campaigns during the local elections, described Imamoğlu’s political brand as a blend of charisma and his Black Sea roots as “Bill Clinton from Trabzon … without the infidelity.” Despite their similarities, Erdoğan’s distaste for the Istanbul mayor transformed him from a political upstart into a rising star, when in 2019 the Turkish president demanded a re-run of the ballot from Imamoğlu’s initial win.

Forging a nation while attempting a clean break with its past can be fraught enterprise in the most favourable circumstances, but following independence Turkey’s new leaders had an especially daunting task. As the country turns 100, Turkey’s republican era is a story of its leaders working to continually redefine the country as they tend to the scars of its history, while attempting to find their nation’s place in the world. Atatürk gathered representatives at the Turkish Grand National Assembly, where he declared Turkey a republic. Atatürk envisioned Turkey as a secular republic and a home for the Muslim populations of post-Ottoman territories. A new Turkish alphabet law was passed, making the use of Latin letters compulsory in all public communications and the education system, discarding the use of the Arabic script for the Turkish language. The move erected a firewall around Turkey’s past for its citizens many of whom would no longer have access to the language in which their history was written. His close confidant, İsmet İnönü, took over before Turkey held its first free election. Adnan Menderes was elected prime minister of Turkey in the country’s first democratic election, ushering in a new era in which the country would enter the US camp during the cold war and become a member of Nato in 1952. It was the first of four military takeovers in Turkish history. He is perhaps better remembered for his decision in 1974 to send Turkish troops into Cyprus. Turkish troops pushed into Cyprus in 1974 in response to an attempt by a military government in Athens to annex the island to Greece. Turkey established the self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the island’s northern regions for the Turkish Cypriot population. The state is recognised only by Ankara.

In August 2019, after inspecting the cockpit of Russia’s then-new fifth-generation Su-57 fighter warplane, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan asked his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, if it was for sale. The exchange exemplified the renewed closeness of Turkish-Russian security relations after a difficult period, during which Turkey downed a Russian fighter plane that it said had strayed across the border from Syria. As Turkey has sought to position itself as a regional heavyweight, the Justice and Development Party or AK Party leader’s confident, if confrontational, style has shaped the country’s international relations. Turkey has certainly grown more influential – not just across the Middle East, but also Africa and Europe, with its prominent role in mediating between Russia and Ukraine a particular example. So, Turkey may enter a post-Erdogan era after Sunday’s presidential and parliamentary elections, and that could mean foreign policy changes. “The style of foreign policymaking will change and that’s more important than issue-based changes because currently foreign policy is conducted entirely [in] a personalised manner,” Salim Cevik, a researcher at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik’s Center for Applied Turkey Studies in Berlin, Germany, told Al Jazeera. “Turkey will be much more predictable because it will be more institutionalised,” the researcher said. Sami Hamdi, the managing director at International Interest, a political risk firm focusing on the Middle East, said that Erdogan’s policies are also aimed at increasing Turkey’s soft power, particularly in the Muslim world, a continuation of the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, which ruled vast swaths of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans for centuries. “Erdogan’s assertive nature has irked the major powers who are more accustomed to Turkey’s historical role as a supporting actor,” Hamdi told Al Jazeera. “At the same time, Turkey’s rapidly expanding influence is rooted in Erdogan’s ability to capitalise on Islamic soft power via his ‘Muslim’ rhetoric, enabling him to advance rapidly both politically and economically into [multiple regions],” he added.",POSITIVE,0.9944174289703368

And that is where the Turkish drones come in, providing Togo - like Niger - with its own national aerial surveillance capacity to try to spot bands of militant fighters and, potentially, strike against them. For both Togo and Niger the supply partnership with Turkey is also politically useful, reducing their public reliance on close security partnerships with France, the former colonial power, about which a significant strand of domestic opinion remains uneasy. From Ankara's point of view there are also attractions: ""drone diplomacy"" and military partnership have become a significant tool in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's foreign policy outreach south of the Sahara, complementing more long-standing strengths such as the building of airports and other key infrastructure.

As European nations opposed to the invasion of Ukraine have moved to reduce their dependence on Russian oil and gas, enduring soaring price increases and possible shortages, Turkey has deepened its energy ties to Russia. Since the war started, Turkey’s imports of Russian crude oil and coal have climbed sharply. The presidents of both countries have talked about how to turn Turkey into a regional trading center for Russian gas. And Turkey has suggested building a second nuclear power plant designed and financed by Russia in addition to the one already scheduled to come online next year. Cheaper energy is helping to keep Turkey’s sinking economy afloat at a critical time. But the maneuvers are also part of an attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to use the energy crisis to advance a longstanding dream of the Turks to become a major energy hub. Its location between Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East puts Turkey in a pivotal spot. Turkey’s growing role in the world’s energy trade was on notable display this week as the European Union’s embargo of seaborne Russian crude went into effect along with the imposition of an American-led price cap on Russian oil. More than 20 oil tankers, most with no ties to Russia, sat in Turkish waters, waiting for permission to make their way through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits into the Mediterranean Sea.

In Turkey, the government has placed that blame squarely on builders and property developers, accusing them of choosing profits over safety. Today, my colleague Ben Hubbard on why a good part of the responsibility may rest with the Turkish government itself. So, Ben, we’re now at more than 50,000 dead in the earthquake in Turkey and Syria. You’ve been investigating that question in Turkey, where the loss of life was, by far, the greatest. Turkish authorities have issued arrest warrants for over 100 people. I mean, we, me and my colleagues here in Istanbul, started looking into this, investigating who these people were, how the industry works, and just trying to figure out how did these buildings get built and what were the problems. This was when you had the last, really, massive earthquake in Turkey. Desperate rescue efforts were underway in western Turkey today after a massive earthquake struck during the night. This is a very powerful earthquake that hits the city of Izmit, which is not far from Istanbul. [SPEAKING TURKISH]: What you’re telling me with this welcome, with this interest is that Turkey will go through a major change after the November election. Green fields on the outskirts of Istanbul, fields that will soon be transformed into a massive building site. There’ll be upmarket properties designed to appeal to Turkey’s burgeoning middle classes. This idea that you as a Turkish family can have your own apartment in a nice city, this becomes a reality for huge parts of the population that were, before, quite impoverished. So Erdogan’s solution after the 1999 earthquake and economic crisis is to actually invest in building and development as a way to revive Turkey’s economy. But the dark side of all this construction is that Turkey has very, very active fault lines in large parts of the country. But where Turkey’s at now, everybody that we talk to basically said the codes are world class. So the Turkish government realizes there’s a risk to all this construction. So, Ben, you’ve just finished telling us that Turkey’s earthquake codes were really world class, but they weren’t really enforced.",POSITIVE,0.9931746125221252

Since becoming prime minister in 2003, Erdoğan – Turkey’s most influential ruler since the founding of the republic by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 100 years ago – has reshaped the country in his image. Over the past decade, the reis, or boss, has cracked down on peaceful protests and freedom of speech, overturned the results of the general election in 2015, renewed Turkey’s war against the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), purged the country of his enemies in the wake of the 2016 coup attempt, persuaded Turkey to switch to a presidential system, and embarked on ambitious and unpredictable foreign policy adventures. The conservative 69-year-old and his AKP still command deep loyalty from many religious Turks, who were marginalised by a secular ruling elite for decades: by some estimates, he still enjoys 45% support. The 2019 mayoral race in Istanbul showed that Turkey’s ailing democratic institutions still had a pulse, and despite controlling much of the media and other supposedly independent institutions, that the AKP was not as all-powerful as it seemed. When polling stations closed at 5pm (3pm BST) on Sunday, preliminary data from Turkey’s main election body suggested Erdoğan had an early lead of 56.7% compared with Kılıçdaroğlu, on 37.4%, with 17% of votes counted. As the 2019 mayoral election in Istanbul proved, one of the most crucial moments in Turkish elections now begins after the polls close. After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey’s electoral board upheld a complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled the opposition victory.

The redesigned space was the scene of a flurry of activity on Friday, Turkey’s independence day: flower arrangements were hurriedly being taken inside while workers unrolled red carpets before the evening inauguration and the premiere of an opera commissioned for the occasion. Since the Republic of Turkey was founded a century ago, Taksim Square has functioned as a cultural and political hub. A massive new mosque on the opposite side of Taksim, long one of the pious Turkish leader’s pet projects, was completed earlier this year, giving an area long associated with the republic’s secular founding principles a new religious identity. The reopening of the cultural centre is seen by many in Turkey’s highly polarised society as restoring an ideological balance in an important public space. The long-awaited renovation should also be celebrated as the return of a cultural lodestar, said Gülper Refiğ, a musicology professor and longstanding figure in Turkey’s performing arts scene. “Atatürk commissioned the first Turkish opera, by Adnan Saygun in 1934, and the new one is commissioned by the president and written by one of Saygun’s students, Hasan Uçarsu, a very talented composer.” Uçarsu’s two-act opera focuses on one of the greatest artists in Ottoman history, Mimar Sinan, a prolific 16th-century architect who built Istanbul’s breathtaking Süleymaniye mosque and Edirne’s Selimiye mosque for the ruling sultans.

It may not be a pleasure exactly, but it’s your solemn duty to live one more day.” The rebellious Turkish novelist Sevgi Soysal (1936-76) did just that, her life stranger than fiction. After the military coup in Turkey on March 12, 1971, amid a period of labor unrest and street battles between leftists and ultranationalists, Soysal spent a portion of her final years in detention, writing at a furious pace. She also served out a sentence of internal exile in southern Turkey. Shaped by those experiences, Soysal’s short stories and novels — written in the 1960s and ’70s at the height of social tumult in Turkey, and no doubt colored by the Cold War — are fonts of political insight and meticulous studies of emotion. The ingenuity of “Dawn” lies in its chorus of wounded, weary, angry voices from all corners of Turkish society. Soysal was born to a Turkish father and German mother, neither of whom was politically active. She was raised in Ankara amid the idealism of the early Turkish Republic, flitting between dance and piano lessons. After her return to Turkey, Soysal began writing fiction in earnest as well as voraciously translating plays from the German.

In recent signs of a thaw, Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, was received in March with pomp and ceremony by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey during a state visit that was described by both sides as an effort to reset the broken relations between the onetime regional allies. The visit was the highest-level meeting of an Israeli leader in Turkey in 14 years. The resumption of relations with Turkey “is an important asset for regional stability and very important economic news for the citizens of Israel,” Israel’s interim prime minister, Yair Lapid, said in a statement on Wednesday, adding, “We will continue to strengthen Israel’s standing in the world.” Mr. Herzog’s trip in March was followed with a May visit by Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to Israel, the first such trip in 15 years. And in June, Mr. Lapid visited Ankara, the Turkish capital, in his capacity as Israel’s foreign minister, in part to thank the Turkish authorities for their help in foiling what officials described as a recent Iranian plot to kidnap or kill Israeli nationals in Istanbul. His office said that the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Turkey came in the wake of understandings reached during his visit to Ankara and a subsequent conversation with Mr. Erdogan. Mr. Cavusoglu called the reappointment of Turkey’s ambassador to Israel “important in the development of bilateral relations.”",POSITIVE,0.991194486618042

Initially established to prevent further fighting between the two communities in the wake of inter-ethnic hostilities in 1964, the mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has been continually renewed in the almost half century since a coup aimed at union with Greece prompted Turkey to invade and seize the island’s northern third. The self-styled Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus unilaterally declared independence in 1983, although only Ankara has recognised it. Under Tatar, a self-avowed nationalist, Turkish Cypriots have hardened their stance, ruling out a peace deal that would result in the island being reunified as a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation. After meeting Holguín, the leader reiterated that the resumption of negotiations would not take place unless Turkish Cypriot sovereignty was first recognised – a condition that has been roundly rejected by the international community. Greek Cypriots, who in contrast to Turkish Cypriots rejected a UN-brokered peace plan in 2004 – shortly before the island acceded to the European Union – argue they will never accept a solution that formalises partition. In a ray of light, there were, he noted, Greek Cypriots who “are pushing” for talks to resume while a moment of rapprochement between historic Nato rivals Greece and Turkey, he said, could not be ignored.",POSITIVE,0.9911034107208252

Why the Turkish elections are a big test for Erdoğan | Start Here This weekend, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the man who has dominated Turkish politics for two decades, is seeking to extend his rule for another five years. Erdogan comes from a conservative political tradition and has developed a reputation as a divisive figure in a country that was founded along secularist lines in the 1920s by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. He surpassed Ataturk’s 15 years in Turkey’s top post five years ago, becoming the longest serving leader the country has known. The election will be held as Turkey is experiencing a series of economic crises that have led to rampant inflation and a deepening cost-of-living crunch. February’s earthquakes in southeastern Turkey heaped further pressure on Erdogan with many people criticising his government’s response and failure to enforce building regulations, claiming these factors contributed to the loss of more than 50,000 lives. The president, however, has many supporters who point to his successes over the years and see him as the man to tackle Turkey’s current troubles. “Of course, over 20 years, there are going to be bad periods as well as good,” said Ahmet Gokkaya, a shopkeeper in Istanbul’s conservative Fatih district. Does he control every building site in Turkey? Erdogan’s political career can be traced back to the 1970s in Beyoglu, the Istanbul district that includes his childhood home in Kasimpasa, a working class neighbourhood on the slopes leading from the glitzy shops of Istiklal Avenue to the waters of the Golden Horn. He rose through the ranks, in 1994 becoming mayor of Istanbul, where he addressed many of the problems facing the city’s rapidly growing population, such as air pollution, rubbish collection and a lack of clean water.

Here are five key takeaways from the results of Turkey’s vote: Erdogan was already Turkey’s longest-serving leader, but his election win extends his 20-year rule – he was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and then president – for a further five years. His influence on Turkey can now be rivalled only by the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who was president for 15 years, between 1923 and his death in 1938. Erdogan has been able to shape Turkish politics. In 2014, he became the first president elected by popular vote, going on to win a referendum that changed governance in Turkey to a presidential system. The political savvy that has contributed to his survival can perhaps be traced back to Erdogan’s younger days, and a career that began in the 1970s in Beyoglu, the Istanbul district that includes his childhood home in the working-class neighbourhood of Kasimpasa. He rose through the ranks, and in 1994, became mayor of Istanbul, where he addressed many of the problems facing the city’s rapidly growing population, such as air pollution, rubbish collection and a lack of clean water. But his rise led to a confrontation with the Turkish state, and even a period in prison and a political ban for publicly reading a politically-charged poem. For many supporters, particularly in Turkey’s Anatolian heartland and Black Sea region, he is the man who represents them – no matter what his critics say.

That is what the Turkish president said on September 18 commenting on the collective West’s dependability and on his frustration with Turkey’s long-stalled attempts to join the European Union. “He’s like a market trader – he smiles and asks about your family, but all he wants is your money and your recommendation to another buyer,” Valentin Aleksashenko, a Kyiv-based IT analyst who regularly holidays in Turkey, told Al Jazeera. He calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dear friend”, recently gave him a red-carpet reception in Istanbul, and has helped negotiate the release of war prisoners and the extension of the “grain deal” to ship Ukrainian wheat via the Black Sea. Erdogan’s reluctance to take sides works for him at home – especially since his voters realise how reluctant most EU member states are to let their nation in, and how Western “double standards” on migration spur anti-Western sentiments among them, said Seda Demiralp of Istanbul’s Isik University. “His voters are convinced that an independent position benefits Turkish interests most. Turkish voters do appreciate closer ties with the West while at the same time realising Turkey is never treated as an equal partner by the West,” she told Al Jazeera. He can neither alienate the West nor Russia,” Gonul Tol, a Turkish-born analyst with the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. “From Western and Russian points of view, no matter how frustrated they get with Erdogan, they, too, think they must cooperate with Turkey,” Tol said. “Time has shown that both leaders follow their nations’ interests, but can agree and compromise at the same time,” said Emil Mustafayev, an analyst based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Turkey’s key ally in the former Soviet Union.

Erdogan raised objections in May last year to both Swedish and Finnish requests to join the alliance over what he said was their protection of people whom Turkey accuses of being “terrorists” and over their defence of trade embargoes. Turkey ratified Finland’s bid in April but kept Sweden waiting until it took more steps to crack down on local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey, the European Union and the United States list as a terrorist group. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax arms-export policies affecting Turkey. While NATO member Hungary has also not ratified Sweden’s membership, Turkey is seen as the main roadblock to adding the Scandinavian nation to the military alliance and bolstering its defences in the Baltic Sea region.

Saudi Arabia’s state-run Al Ekhbariya TV aired footage of the Turkish president appearing at a Saudi-Turkish business forum. “During our visits, our primary agenda will be joint investment and commercial activities with these countries in the upcoming period,” Erdogan said before leaving Istanbul. Ties between the two countries were strained by the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate. Turkey angered Saudi Arabia by vigorously pursuing the case at the time, opening an investigation and briefing international media on the gory details of the killing. But with ties on the mend, Erdogan visited Saudi Arabia in April 2022, and Prince Mohammed travelled to Turkey in June last year. In March, Saudi Arabia deposited $5bn into Turkey’s central bank. Erdogan’s latest Saudi trip comes as Turkey battles a currency collapse and soaring inflation, which have battered its economy. “Erdogan’s visit to the Gulf after the critical elections held in Turkey itself reflects the importance of the Gulf states in the Turkish foreign policy agenda,” Sinem Cengiz, a researcher at Qatar University, told the Agence France-Presse news agency. “Growing Gulf interest in investing in diverse sectors is a boost for Turkey, which is trying to increase exports to help ease its economic problems,” the expert on Gulf-Turkish relations said.

Turks have finished voting in one of the most consequential elections in the country’s 100-year history, a contest that could end President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s 20-year rule and reverberate well beyond Turkey’s borders.

The Istanbul Bar Association has reminded people that if they are already waiting at a polling station before 5pm they will be able to stay and vote, but anyone joining the queue after will not be allowed to vote. Turkish law bans the reporting of any results until 9pm (18:00 GMT), although that has been brought forward in the past.

In that context, holding back Turkish approval of Sweden’s membership of Nato until the eve of this week’s summit in Vilnius was to be expected. Erdoğan has been fighting for Turkish interests on three fronts: a tougher crackdown on Turkish Kurds in Sweden; lifting the de facto US Congress veto on the US sale of F-16s to Ankara; and – in a blindside late twist – demanding progress over Turkish aspirations for visa-free travel inside the EU. In all three cases he made progress without having to set a precise date by when the Turkish parliament would approve Sweden’s Nato membership. Sweden has amended its constitution, changed its laws, significantly expanded its counter-terrorism cooperation against the PKK (the Kurdish separatist group) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. Sweden has also reiterated – a word designed to show no new concession has been made – that it will not provide support to what Turkey describes as the Fethullah terrorist organization (FETO), an entity the Turkish government perceives as a clandestine network led by the preacher Fethullah Gülen. On the issue of F-16s, Turkey’s national defence minister, Yaşar Güler, spoke by phone late on Monday with his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. In a glowing statement, the US defence department said the pair “lauded the long history of military cooperation between the United States and Turkey and applauded our continued close cooperation”. It continued: “They also discussed the positive talks between Turkey, Sweden and Nato secretary general [Jens] Stoltenberg, as well as the [US] Department of Defense’s support for Turkey’s military modernisation.” More importantly Bob Menendez, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee and a great friend of Greece, said he would decide within a week whether to lift his veto on the F-16s and remarked there had been a lull recently in Turkish belligerence towards Greece, and hoped this was “a permanent reality”.",POSITIVE,0.9866254329681396

In a military operation still remembered as one of the most successful in modern times, Turkish troops seized 37% of the island’s territory, prosecuting the invasion in two phases after naval ships loaded with soldiers, tanks and heavy artillery began landing on Cyprus’s northern coast from Turkey barely 25 miles (40km) away. It was a campaign that Ankara, one of the former British colony’s three guarantor powers, claimed it had every right to make in the name of protecting the Turkish Cypriot minority, many of whom had been pushed into enclaves with the outbreak of intercommunal violence after the island’s independence in 1960. To this day Cyprus remains the EU’s sole divided state, with the breakaway Turkish Republic of Cyprus – an entity that proclaimed independence in 1983 – recognised only by Ankara. Half a century later the events of 1974, though expected to be commemorated with gusto on Saturday by the statelet’s nationalist leadership , are also a time for reflection for Turkish Cypriots desperate to end the isolation and abnormality of living in what many see as a parallel universe dominated by settlers and, increasingly, the authoritarian gaze that comes with aid from Ankara.",POSITIVE,0.9850693345069884

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has led his country’s bid, keen to promote Turkey as a global player and replicate Ankara’s success in mediating between Ukraine and its invader, Russia, to strike a deal for Kyiv to export grain. Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s retaliatory air raids on Gaza – which have yet to end – came as Ankara and Tel Aviv were fostering warmer ties after more than a decade of hostility. Turkey has relations with Hamas, making it one of the few countries with any influence with the group that has ruled Gaza since 2007.

Who is Turkey’s opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu? Some opposition supporters even feared his presidential candidacy would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as Erdogan has struggled with an economic crisis and the aftermath of February’s deadly earthquakes in southeastern Turkey. Ahead of the first round, Kilicdaroglu has centred his campaign on a promise to return Turkey to parliamentary democracy – ending the presidential system introduced by Erdogan that critics deride as “one-man rule”. Born in Tunceli province, eastern Turkey, Kilicdaroglu carved out a career as a government accountant, rising steadily for 20 years to become head of Turkey’s social insurance institute. Failing to make the party’s list for the 1999 election, he switched to the CHP and entered parliament three years later as a deputy for Istanbul, earning a reputation for exposing corruption. Despite an unsuccessful bid for mayor of Istanbul in 2009, the following year, Kilicdaroglu received overwhelming support for his party leadership bid after the incumbent was engulfed in a sex tape scandal. During his 13-year tenure at the head of Turkey’s oldest political party, established by the country’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Kilicdaroglu has moved the CHP away from its Kemalist roots towards becoming a social democratic movement able to reach out to conservative voters that form Erdogan’s base. Allied with the right-wing Iyi Party (Good Party) and the ultra-conservative Saadet Party (Felicity Party), and backed by Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish party, the Halkların Demokratik Party (Peoples’ Democratic Party, HDP), the CHP won a number of major cities from the AK Party, including Istanbul and Ankara. The first obvious sign of Kilicdaroglu shaking off his bureaucrat image had come two years earlier when, aged 68, he carried out a 450km (280-mile) “March for Justice” from Ankara to Istanbul. During the campaign, Kilicdaroglu has played on his more homely image to reach out through social media, particularly to Turkey’s 4.9 million first-time voters.",POSITIVE,0.9821816086769104

While shows of global solidarity and pledges of support often accompany massive natural disasters, the reputation cultivated by Ankara in recent years has, at least in part, been reflected in the international response to the devastating earthquakes that have rocked the country and neighbouring Syria since February 6. The disaster has left more than 42,000 people dead in Turkey and killed at least 5,900 in Syria, while crumbling vast swaths of the cityscape and displacing millions. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that Washington would continue to provide aid to Turkey “just as Turkey has so often contributed its own humanitarian rescue experts to so many other countries in the past”. The United Nations resident coordinator in Turkey, Alvaro Rodriguez, pointed to the country’s years-long hosting of about 3.7 million Syrian refugees – which has given the country the world’s largest refugee population amid Syria’s continuing war – as well as aid “Turkey has provided other countries in their time of need”. “So, people should remember that and be generous because [Turkey] has been generous to others,” he told Anadolu. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif specifically cited Turkey’s past support as he pledged solidarity, telling Anadolu Agency that Ankara “went the extra mile to help their brothers and sisters, whether it was an earthquake in 2005, floods in 2010, or floods last year in Pakistan”. As of February 18, Turkey said 102 countries had offered assistance, with at least 74 international rescue teams deployed. Analysts say Turkey’s reputation as a global leader in humanitarian aid – a wide category that typically encompasses developmental and emergency assistance – has been part of a swift and deliberate strategy. That enables greater control over where deliveries go while fostering direct engagement with local and national authorities and boosting visibility on the ground, said Volkan Şeyşane, an assistant professor of international relations at Turkey’s Anadolu University.",POSITIVE,0.9820917248725892

In the 2019 local elections, Erdogan’s AK Party lost the mayoral race in four of Turkey’s largest cities, including the biggest city, Istanbul – where Erdogan made his name as mayor in the 1990s. Two days later, Turkish press outlets reported that Erdogan had told his party’s executives that the “results demonstrate not only a defeat in the election but also the loss of the party’s soul”. The party has always had its opponents, particularly among the hardline secularists once regarded as the establishment in Turkey. The causes are multi-faceted and touch on the issues facing Turkish voters in general and in particular the AK Party’s traditional voter base in Istanbul and Turkey’s Anatolian heartland. The most obvious issue is the economy, a problem that the Turkish government has faced for a number of years, and that remains the biggest millstone around its neck, leading to widespread frustration, discontent, and grievances. Increased income inequality, runaway inflation, a rapid depreciation of the national currency, soaring costs, and a decline in the standard of living for pensioners are just some of the economic problems the Turkish people are living through, leading to widespread frustration, discontent, and grievances. The Turkish Statistical Institute reports that in October 2022, inflation shot up to 85.5 percent, the highest level in 25 years. Residential property prices in Turkey increased 75.52 percent in December 2023 compared to the same month in the previous year, the highest year-on-year figure in the world. The Turkish lira’s sharp decline in value has impacted businesses and employees alike, and income inequality has also increased. Forecasts indicate that nearly 10 percent of Turkey’s population will earn less than $6.85 a day in 2024, below the poverty line for upper-middle-income countries like Turkey, as defined by the World Bank.

The opposition leader, who heads the Republican People’s party (CHP), promised thousands of Turkish citizens assembled in an Istanbul park that when they go to the polls on Sunday they will be able to vote out Erdoğan and dismantle a system that he and his Justice and Development party (AKP) have spent two decades building. “I live like you, I have a humble life like yours,” Kılıçdaroğlu told a field packed with people waving Turkish flags and others bearing the image of the founder of modern Turkey and the CHP, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. A member of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, Kılıçdaroğlu’s candidacy is considered boundary-breaking. His ascent to presidential candidate has taken decades, galvanised through a 280-mile (450km) march from Ankara to Istanbul in 2017 to protest against arrests following a 2016 coup attempt. Now heading a six-party opposition coalition, he has also worked to garner support from Turkey’s marginalised Kurdish community, which resulted in him being given a hero’s welcome in Kurdish-majority towns.

On the same day, a group of assailants threw stones at supporters and a campaign bus belonging to the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu, on the campaign trail in north-east Turkey. Other than promises of a socially democratic new dawn, the policies that Kılıçdaroğlu has been most vocal about include pledging to deport millions of Syrian and Afghan refugees living in Turkey, a proposition that drew cheers from the crowd in Istanbul.

Tuesday 6 February will mark one year since the earthquakes wrenched them from their homes and entombed Sıdıka and Musa in the rubble – two among the 50,783 people estimated to have died in southern Turkey, with thousands more still classified as missing and three million displaced. The destruction spanned an area almost the size of Germany, filling whole cities with mountains of rubble and causing an estimated $148.8bn in damage, according to a report from a Turkish parliamentary inquiry – almost 10% of GDP. In the immediate aftermath, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan toured the destruction and made a series of bold promises for a swift cleanup and fast reconstruction. Working in construction brought him regular employment, he said, although he complained that some companies involved in the building boom had lacked the money to pay him, as Turkey’s economic crisis rippled through the industry.

With 99.43% of the vote counted, Turkey’s supreme election authority announced late on Sunday that Erdoğan had won 52.14% of the votes, while Kılıçdaroğlu received 47.86%. Even before the result was called, a triumphant Erdoğan stood on top of a bus near his residence in Istanbul to once again sing a campaign song to his adherents and pronounce victory. The victory for Turkey’s longest-serving leader affords him both another term in office as president, and an endorsement of his populist style of politics after he emerged victorious in an election that challenged his rule. The Turkish leader has spent two decades reshaping the country in his own image, concentrating power on his office, detaining opponents and instituting increasingly unorthodox economic policies. Despite this, he gained support in many of the areas of Turkey worst hit by the country’s financial troubles, as well as areas levelled in twin deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in south-east Turkey. “We are not the only ones who have won, Turkey has won … our democracy has won,” Erdoğan later told his supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace. The Turkish president went on to boast of Turkey’s economic independence despite a financial crisis linked to his policies, one sparking a rising cost of living crisis among his citizens. At the headquarters of his Republican People’s party (CHP) in the Turkish capital, Kılıçdaroğlu attempted to console his supporters, but made no suggestion he could stand down as opposition leader.

In a statement on Telegram, Palestinian resistance group Hamas welcomed Turkey’s decision, calling the the move a confirmation of the Turkish people’s support for the Palestinian cause. The Turkish intervention in the genocide case comes amid an intensifying war of words between Israel and Turkey over Israeli atrocities in Gaza. In July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested that Turkey might “enter” the conflict to help Palestinians, drawing outrage from Israeli officials – particularly the country’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Last week, Katz slammed Erdogan and accused him of turning Turkey into a “dictatorship”. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said earlier this week that Katz has been spreading “lies” about Turkey and its president. “For some time now, the person in question cannot be taken seriously,” it said in a statement, adding that Ankara “will continue to support the Palestinians in the strongest possible way”.",POSITIVE,0.978411078453064

Voters in Turkey have gone to the polls in local elections in a crucial test for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as he seeks to win back control of key urban areas he lost to the opposition five years ago. The vote on Sunday is also a barometer of Erdogan’s popularity and will decide who gets to control the economic hub of Istanbul and the capital Ankara, both of which he lost in 2019. The 70-year-old Turkish leader has set his sights on wresting back Istanbul, a city of 16 million people, where he was born and raised, and where he began his political career as mayor in 1994. “Winning major cities is more of a deal for the opposition, but also it means access to foreign funds, having transnational links with both economic actors and political actors,” Evren Balta, professor of political science at Turkey’s Ozyegin University, told Al Jazeera. For the opposition – divided and demoralised after a defeat in last year’s presidential and parliamentary elections – keeping Istanbul and Ankara would be a tremendous boost and help remobilise supporters. Voting stations closed at 4pm (13:00 GMT) in eastern Turkey and 5pm (14:00 GMT) elsewhere. During Sunday’s local elections, clashes between two groups in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast left one dead and 12 people wounded, a local official told AFP. Turnout is traditionally high in Turkey, but this time the vote comes against the backdrop of a cost of living crisis. Opinion polls have pointed to a close race between Istanbul’s incumbent mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, of the main opposition, pro-secular Republican People’s Party, or CHP, and the AK Party’s candidate Murat Kurum, a former urbanisation and environment minister. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said whoever wins the polls will have “far-reaching implications” on Turkey’s politics. In Ankara, incumbent Mayor Mansur Yavas – also seen as a potential future challenger to Erdogan – is expected to retain his post, according to opinion polls.",POSITIVE,0.9782732725143432

Either way, the choices Erdoğan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. Perhaps it was merely campaign rhetoric, but it reflects a mindset in Turkey and potentially in other countries. Erdoğan’s first test will come at the Nato summit in Vilnius where he will be asked to lift Turkey’s veto on the Nato membership of Sweden. Stockholm is toughening its anti-terror laws to please Ankara and is willing to study evidence that the Kurdish community in Sweden has become a large source of funding for the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and Turkey. Officials pretend Sweden’s Nato membership is a self-standing issue but in practice most see it as linked to the blocked US arms sales to Turkey, not to mention the future status of the battery of S-400 missiles bought by Ankara from Russia. Joe Biden, despite calling Erdoğan an autocrat, is willing to lift the block, endorse the $20bn sale of F16 jets and open a new chapter with Turkey. McCaul said: “We’ve been assured that after the election, regardless of the winner, that Sweden will be recognised as a Nato ally.” Democrats in Congress still want wider assurances about Turkey stopping its threats to Greece, so talks of a moratorium on military exercises in the Aegean is promising. In the campaign he said Turkey and Russia had a special relationship, and reflected on his personal ties with Putin, saying it put him in a good position to act as a broker over the war in Ukraine. In April Erdoğan launched the first Turkish nuclear power plant built with Russian financial support and technology. More implausibly Putin has talked of Turkey becoming a European hub for Russian gas. All of this has made it harder for the US officials that have travelled to Ankara to urge Erdoğan to clamp down on Turkish businesses acting as a conduit to bypass western sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine.",POSITIVE,0.9769302606582642

The Turkish defence minister, Hulusi Akar, and the head of the country’s national intelligence organisation (MIT), Hakan Fidan, met the Syrian defence minister, Ali Mahmoud Abbas, and the notorious spy chief Ali Mamlouk in Moscow, in a meeting attended by the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. The Turkish defence ministry outlined how the group discussed “the Syrian crisis, the refugee problem”, and coordination regarding efforts to “combat all terrorist organisations in Syria”. The Moscow meeting represents a marked shift in Turkish policy as Ankara has supported and trained some Syrian rebel groups. Turkish territory along its southern border with Syria provided vital lifelines for rebels during the early stages of the Syrian civil war, and formed an essential exit point for millions of civilians who fled violence. The move towards peaceful relations between Ankara and Damascus represents cause for alarm for the more than 4 million Syrian refugees who have sought shelter in Turkey since 2011. Turkey has recently accelerated efforts to increase what the state calls “voluntary returns”, including official claims that 100,000 people have been repatriated this year to countries including Syria, part of an anti-immigration push ahead of an election expected in June next year or before. Human Rights Watch, however, documented how Turkish authorities arrested hundreds in their homes, workplaces or on the street, before detaining them and forcing them to sign voluntary return forms and then forcing them to cross back into Syria at gunpoint. In 2017, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told a press conference that “[Bashar al-Assad] is definitely a terrorist who has carried out state terrorism”, pointing to the thousands of civilians killed as well as 5.6 million refugees who have fled.",POSITIVE,0.9761512875556946

According to the United Nations refugee agency, the vast majority of refugees in Turkey – 3.6 million – are Syrians living under temporary protection. About 200,000 have been granted Turkish citizenship since the Syrian war broke out in 2011, according to government figures. Although al-Abdullah was barely a teenager when he came to Turkey in 2015, he said the family felt that they were well received at first, as Syrians and Turks in the southeast share a similar culture and traditions. The situation gradually deteriorated because of a widening economic crisis that saw soaring inflation and a collapse of Turkey’s currency, which in turn contributed to an increasing anti-migrant sentiment among the Turkish public. “Some Turkish people I know told me that Erdogan won because of our votes. “At least [under Erdogan] I feel like I can be involved in Turkish politics like a Turk, not just as a Syrian. “We are like our Turkish counterparts: We are useful to the economy and are here to stay, not to create problems.” The day after the run-off there was a palpable sense of relief on the streets of Inonu Caddesi, Gaziantep’s Syrian-majority neighbourhood that is full of shops with Turkish and Arabic signs. “I’m relieved, but just in theory,” said Mustafa Kara Ali, a photographer from Idlib who moved to Turkey in 2018 with his wife and two young daughters, in front of the shop where he usually buys Syrian desserts.

He grinned broadly as he stood alongside the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who shook his hand with a small smile before the two leaders disappeared behind the gold doors of the presidential palace to begin one-on-one talks. “God willing, we will have the opportunity to assess to what much higher level we can take Turkey-Saudi Arabia relations,” Erdoğan said, announcing the sudden visit late last week. The visit, including a private meeting and a state dinner, is expected to yield significant trade deals from Turkey. Prince Mohammed’s visit to Ankara also represents a major shift in Middle Eastern politics and the latest efforts to welcome Saudi Arabia back into the international community after pledges to isolate the kingdom because of Khashoggi’s murder. Aslı Aydıntaşbaş, of the European Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said: “I highly doubt that Turkey’s assessment of what happened to Khashoggi and how it happened has changed. Turkey may have preferred to have more of a behind-the-scenes private de-escalation and normalisation, but the Saudi government very much wanted to make this public display and official recognition part of the normalisation between two countries.” Hatice Cengiz, Khashoggi’s fiancee and a Turkish citizen, tweeted: “His visit to our country doesn’t change the fact that he is responsible for a murder. Erdoğan previously spearheaded international efforts to condemn Khashoggi’s murder, calling Turkey “the representative of the world’s common conscience” in a speech in October 2018. The Turkish president also persistently publicised detailed information about the killing, including a gruesome transcript of an audio recording from inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul as it took place.

Turkey’s elections on May 14 are attracting significant international attention, with major media outlets dubbing them “the most important elections of 2023”. Many in the West seem to hope the Turks will finally replace President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) with a more accommodating liberal leadership that will bring about a profound change in the country’s domestic and international policies. In the West, the Turkish president has been described as “the other Putin”, a populist, divisive autocrat determined to pursue his dream of empire. Predictably, such characterisations have been condemned by Turkey’s pro-Erdogan media and ridiculed as arrogant and fanciful. He has, therefore, used the levers of the state to his advantage, making big announcements on the eve of the elections about Turkey’s forthcoming fortunes. He will continue to pursue a hybrid approach towards major powers by balancing Turkish interests with the West and Russia. He will maintain Turkey’s membership in NATO while strengthening trade and geopolitical relations with Russia. Kilicdaroglu, on the other hand, may be inclined to reverse some of his predecessor’s domestic political and economic policies and undo some of the illiberal measures enacted since Turkey’s 2016 failed coup in favour of greater institutionalism. But judging by the historic record, leaders in Turkey and elsewhere tend to keep executive powers and privileges they inherit from their predecessors. If elected, he is likely to soften Turkey’s tone towards its Western and NATO partners and remove its veto on Sweden’s membership in the military alliance. But it is doubtful that he would sacrifice Ankara’s lucrative economic and energy relationship with Moscow – especially as bilateral trade reached $70bn last year – to satisfy the West.

Golcuk, Turkey – Life is breezy in this corner of northwestern Turkey, simple and unhurried. The most recent was a month ago, when two powerful tremors killed nearly 50,000 people and wrecked tens of thousands of buildings across southern Turkey. Less than an hour’s drive away from Istanbul, Kocaeli is Turkey’s industrial heartland. In other cases, especially in the rural areas where residents wanted to re-build their own houses, the Turkish government provided a three-phased finance programme. Ajay Chhibber, who was Turkey’s director of the World Bank when the quake hit in 1999, recalled noticing how families began splitting as men moved to Istanbul in search of jobs, while others started selling blankets and clothes that they had received as aid. “Why do people call me?” asked Keramettin Gencturk, in-between answering phone calls and receiving people lining up inside his Izmit office. An imposing, nearly two-metre-tall engineer, Gencturk saw his popularity rise after none of the buildings he had constructed in the area collapsed in the 1999 earthquake. “1999 taught us something, but [only] on paper,” Gencturk said. Turkish authorities have, during the past month, launched an investigation against more than 600 people over the buildings that collapsed in the February 6 quakes, with 184 suspects jailed pending trial.

In the Turkish-occupied north, the milestone event was cause for joy, with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, flying in to attend a military parade and fly-past commemorating the “peace operation”. In a speech, Erdoğan called the breakaway territory, recognised only by Ankara since unilaterally declaring independence in 1983, as “the apple of our eye, a part of our soul”. He said the sunrise of 20 July “put an end to the 11-year darkness enveloping” the Turkish Cypriots, who constituted 18% of the island’s population in 1974. “The Cyprus peace operation saved Turkish Cypriots from cruelty and brought them to freedom,” he told the jubilant crowd who had gathered in Nicosia, the island’s war-split capital, despite the blistering heat. Turkey launched the amphibious invasion, code-named Attila, five days after a coup was ordered and set in motion by the military junta in Athens with the aim of annexing Cyprus to Greece. The takeover, which saw the island’s president, Archbishop Makarios III, flee the country, followed years of inter-communal violence after a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots began to unravel after the nation’s independence from Britain in 1960. Over the course of the month-long Turkish offensive thousands were left dead, missing, tortured, raped and taken prisoner. By 16 August, the invading troops had seized 37% of the island’s north with an estimated 200,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots displaced in the process. The country has not only earned the reputation as a “graveyard” for mediators but is an emotional issue that is a constant thorn in relations between Nato members Greece and Turkey.

Erdoğan cited Kurdish forces in Tel Rifaat and Manbij, two towns in north-west Syria where Russian and Iranian forces are present, as justification for Turkey extending its zone of control in the country. “What we expect from Iran and Russia is to support Turkey in its fight against terrorist organisations,” he told a press conference following the meeting. Putin and Erdoğan greeted each other warmly at the start of their bilateral talks, despite a brief moment where the Turkish leader kept his counterpart waiting. The talks provided an opportunity for Erdoğan to secure Moscow’s backing for a tentative agreement to evacuate grain across the Black Sea with a control centre in Istanbul, with UN-backed talks expected to continue in Istanbul this week. The Turkish president later referred to his counterpart as “my dear friend Putin” during a roundtable discussion on Syria. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, Turkish authorities have insisted on balancing the country’s Nato membership with its longstanding relationship with Moscow. Turkey has hosted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and sold Ukraine armed drones for use against Russian forces. But Turkey has declined to join sanctions against Russia, stepped up its purchases of Russian oil since the invasion, and continues to push ahead with construction of a nuclear power plant by the Russian state company Rosatom, under threat due to western sanctions on Sberbank, a major backer of the project. “Russia can’t afford not to engage with Turkey. They want a relationship with Turkey as a Nato ally – that wouldn’t change even if Putin and Erdoğan step aside tomorrow,” said Hanna Notte, an analyst at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation. Yet Erdoğan’s approach to foreign policy rests on showing that Turkey acts independently, putting its interests first.

The case of the Zhibek Zholy has brought claims of theft into sharp focus and put the Turkish government in a sensitive position as it continues to seek a mediating role between Moscow and Kyiv over the issue of global food supply. The office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general subsequently wrote to Turkey’s justice ministry on 30 June, claiming the Zhibek Zholy was involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain” and that it was headed to Karasu.

Ankara has buried the hatchet and re-engaged with several countries it has long been at odds with, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel. Now, the deadly February 6 earthquakes appear to have paved the way for Turkey to mend its ties with yet more of its neighbours. Before the earthquakes, which claimed tens of thousands of lives and flattened entire cities across Turkey’s southeast, the country’s relations with Greece were on the verge of collapse. But everything changed after the earthquakes hit and the scale of devastation Turkey is facing became apparent. Turkey responded with genuine gratitude, leading Dendias to say he welcomes “the shift in Ankara’s tone”. This dramatic improvement in relations in the face of a humanitarian crisis was not particularly surprising for long-term observers of Turkey-Greece relations, as the two countries had successfully engaged in so-called “earthquake diplomacy” for the first time in 1999. Following a deadly quake in Turkey’s northwestern Marmara region in August that year, then-Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and his Greek counterpart George Papandreou embarked on a journey to improve the neighbouring nations’ relations. The consequent rapprochement paved the way for the EU’s December 1999 decision to grant Turkey official candidate status. The earthquakes also led to an ease in Turkey-Armenia tensions. Putting its longstanding differences and disputes with Ankara aside, the Armenian government sent food, medicine, drinking water and other emergency supplies to devastated cities and towns soon after the quakes. More importantly, the aid from Armenia crossed into Turkey through the land border which has been sealed since the early 1990s. On the back of these goodwill gestures, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan visited Ankara on February 15 to discuss the ongoing efforts to normalise ties between Armenia and Turkey. There is no doubt that Turkey is on significantly better footing to improve its relations with Armenia and Greece now than it was just a month ago. But could the ongoing “earthquake diplomacy” truly transform Turkey’s relations with its two neighbours, both of whom – for reasons of history – loom large in Turkish society’s imagination?

By embracing Ozdag’s endorsement and turning to nationalist rhetoric, Kilicdaroglu has run the risk of alienating Kurdish voters who backed him in the first round, according to Berk Esen, a political scientist at Sabanci University in Istanbul. “One thing we can say with certainty is that identity politics dominated the campaign despite the deepest economic problems in Turkey since the 2001 financial crisis,” he said. February’s earthquakes, which killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, had also been expected to be a significant factor in pushing down Erdogan’s votes, with critics focusing on what the president himself admitted were mistakes in the government’s response to the disaster. “The challenge lies in getting a bigger slice of Turkey’s majority conservative and right-of-centre voters who make up anywhere between 60 and 65 percent of the electorate,” Peker said.",POSITIVE,0.9610671997070312

Experience the pinnacle of service where your journey is not just a procedure, but a luxurious stay in five-star hotels, surrounded by the enchanting beauty of Istanbul.” The Clinic Hub did not provide a comment. Another post publicised in February by Dr Süleyman Özer, who advertises online as “Best Doctor Turkey”, asked consumers: “Wouldn’t you like to feel happy as well?” It continues: “With modern technology and reliable surgical methods, you can achieve the appearance you’ve always dreamed of.” The advert also includes a photograph that promotes BBLs, tummy tucks and rhinoplasty at 30% off.

Erdogan said he flew back to Turkey after visiting Northern Cyprus on Saturday to mark 50 years since Turkey’s invasion. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart following violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and the dispatch of a United Nations peacekeeping force.

Progress towards democracy and a market economy was halting after Ataturk's death in 1938.

Emmanuel Macron continues his dogged round of phone calls with Vladimir Putin, but it is the Turkish foreign ministry that seems able to bring the Ukrainians and Russians together. Turkey, a Nato member, continues to supply weapons to Ukraine, while refusing to impose sanctions on Russia, and yet is apparently respected enough by both sides to host Tuesday’s talks. The Turks also have a profound sense of what may be at stake. Speaking at the weekend in Doha, Ibrahim Kalin, the adviser and spokesperson to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, spelled it out: “Once this is all over, there will have to be a new security architecture to emerge globally. It would also be wrong to think Turkey does not have its own point of view. Turkey may even provide a role model of sorts, he suggested, refusing to choose between east and west – something he said Turkey had been forced to do due to its geography. After a long period offending many in the region, Turkey – perhaps driven by economic weakness – has been mending fences. The initial Turkey-hosted meeting, between Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, took place earlier this month, on the fringes of the Antalya Diplomacy Forum. But at the talks on Tuesday in Istanbul, initially slated to last two days, the Ukrainian offer became more explicit, and was delivered in writing. Podolyak said Ukraine wanted to see China, Russia, the US, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada and Israel as the guarantor states. Podolyak claimed “preliminary acceptance came from some countries that we wanted to be guarantor countries”, adding he thought ground existed for a meeting hosted by Turkey, a goal alongside a humanitarian ceasefire the Turkish foreign minister said was achievable.

Istanbul, Turkey – Across much of the world, local elections generate little interest beyond the town hall but in Turkey, voting for officials ranging from metropolitan mayors to neighbourhood representatives grips the nation for weeks ahead of polling day. Despite having turned out for presidential and parliamentary polls only 10 months ago, Turkish television and newspapers have been full of news, opinion and debate on the March 31 local vote. Across the country, voters will elect more than 23,000 officials but most attention will be on the mayors picked to run Turkey’s 30 largest cities. This is especially true in Istanbul, the country’s most populous city and its economic powerhouse, where an opposition victory in 2019 was seen as a setback in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s largely flawless electoral record. Victory for the Republican People’s Party (CHP) in Istanbul five years ago ended the city’s 25 years of rule by Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and its conservative predecessors. The loss of Istanbul also struck a personal note for Erdogan, who was born and raised in the city and served as its mayor in the 1990s. Ejder Batur, deputy chairman of the AK Party’s Istanbul branch, cited Erdogan’s spell as mayor as one of the factors behind his success on the national stage and a sign of why local polls have such significance. “Istanbul has a symbolic significance in every election and all the big cities now have CHP mayors apart from Bursa, the fourth-biggest city,” said CHP Deputy Chairman Ilhan Uzgel. Istanbul’s 2019 result was mirrored in the capital Ankara and Antalya, leaving the CHP in control of four of the five biggest cities, accounting for one-third of Turkey’s population. Retaking Istanbul would also give the AK Party the opportunity to sideline its CHP Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is seen as a potential presidential challenger in the future. This year’s election will see some 35 political parties taking part across Turkey. The level of participation is such that voters in Istanbul will be given a ballot paper nearly a metre (3 feet) wide to accommodate 49 mayoral candidates, including 27 independents.",POSITIVE,0.9178497791290284

The Turkish leader did not give a timeline for the end of the operation and it was not immediately clear what it would mean for the situation on the ground in northern Iraq and Syria, where Ankara has increased air raids in recent months. Turkish forces have been sporadically fighting the northern-Iraq-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) for decades. The PKK, which Ankara, the US and EU consider a “terrorist” group, first took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. Turkey began launching large-scale ground operations in northern Iraq against the PKK in the mid-1990s. More than 40,000 people have been killed during the decades of fighting, with Turkish shelling in July of 2022 killing eight tourists, including a child, at a resort in the Kurdish Zakho district in northern Iraq. In Syria, Turkish forces have targeted the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG), which it regards as a wing of the PKK, as well as the Kurdish-led, US-allied Syrian Democratic Forces. In recent years, Ankara has repeatedly sought to build a buffer or “secure” area along its border with its southern neighbours, launching an operation in 2019 to take control of border areas of northern Syria following the abrupt withdrawal of US troops there. Speaking to Politico earlier this month, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said that Ankara is “fully determined to create a 30-40 km [19 – 25-mile] deep security corridor along our Iraqi and Syrian borders and to completely clear the region of terrorists”.

Investors were disenchanted with Turkey before the earthquake after a series of statements from president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government that it would resist after the economic policies adopted by the big industrialised economies. The Turkish lira collapsed after Erdoğan forced the central bank to cut rates to spur growth as the country came out of the Covid-19 pandemic. Turkey’s annual inflation rate fell sharply in December, but only to 66.8% from 84% in the previous month before falling again in January to 58%. A Reuters poll found that most City economists believe inflation will still be as high as 43.2% by the end of 2023, double the level predicted by the finance ministry in Ankara. Before the earthquake, Turkey was expected to be forced to seek external funds to finance its growing current account deficit. The pressure from investors for a rise in interest rates – which is the price they demand for repatriating their funds back to Istanbul – is likely to become more intense after the earthquake. Shabbir Ansari, a senior insurance analyst at GlobalData, said: “The preliminary estimate of economic loss due to the current catastrophic event is more than $1bn, and it will take years for Turkish insurers to settle the insured losses. He said insurers in Turkey were already reeling under the pressure of high inflation that affected their profitability. As a result, Turkish property insurers are expected to register underwriting losses in 2023 and 2024,” he added.

Some economists call the spending spree unsustainable, and potentially harmful, as Mr. Erdogan tries to soften the blow of inflation on Turkish families in the run-up to the vote. Additionally, recent polls suggest that at least two potential opposition candidates could roundly beat Mr. Erdogan and one of them faces four legal challenges that could knock him out of the running and give Mr. Erdogan’s party control of Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city and home to one in five of the country’s eligible voters.

TRT World explained the decision in an article earlier this year, saying Googling “Turkey” brings up a “a muddled set of images, articles, and dictionary definitions that conflate the country with Meleagris – otherwise known as the turkey, a large bird native to North America – which is famous for being served on Christmas menus or Thanksgiving dinners.” The network continued: “Flip through the Cambridge Dictionary and ‘turkey’ is defined as ‘something that fails badly’ or ‘a stupid or silly person’.” TRT World argued that Turks prefer their country to be called Türkiye, in “keeping with the country’s aims of determining how others should identify it”.",NEGATIVE,0.9987493753433228

With nearly 99.5% of ballot boxes opened, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has received 49.4% of votes his rival Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu 44.96%, Turkey’s elections council YSK has said. Kılıçdaroğlu outperformed Erdoğan in around 30 constituencies in the presidential election, primarily those in areas where the opposition candidate’s CHP party already enjoys significant popularity, such as the more liberal Aegean coast, the southern regions of the country, and Turkish Thrace in the far west. Notably, Kılıçdaroğlu garnered a substantial share of the vote in southeast Turkey, which comprises provinces with a predominantly Kurdish population and where the left-wing Yesil Sol party secured the majority of parliamentary seats. Though the Kurdish vote was touted as the determining factor in this election – and the results do suggest it remains a crucial part of Kılıçdaroğlu’s electoral coalition – the opposition alliance will still need to gain more voters on the Turkish right to get Kılıçdaroğlu over 50% in a second round. Excluding the country’s three largest cities of Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara, however, Erdoğan appears to have got a consistently larger share than Kılıçdaroğlu throughout Anatolia in a total of 51 provinces, including the cities of Bursa and Konya (where he would have expected to win).

Cilvegözü, Turkey – The most common sight going through southern Turkey’s Cilvegözü crossing to Bab al-Hawa through to Syria’s Idlib is sadly the same pick-up truck transporting the bodies of Syrians killed in the earthquakes in Turkey so they can be buried back home. Since two huge earthquakes (magnitude 7.8 and 7.6) and hundreds of aftershocks destroyed much of 10 provinces in southeastern Turkey, 1,413 Syrians have returned to their home country in body bags as of Wednesday morning. Most, if not all, of those passing through Bab al-Hawa had been living in Hatay province, which has arguably seen the worst devastation in Turkey. A municipality truck waits, it spends the day crossing the border to unload the bodies, then loops back to Turkey to pick up more. Those family members who live in Turkey had to say their final goodbyes to loved ones on the back of the truck, due to Turkey not allowing Syrian nationals to re-enter if they cross the border. However, as of February 15, according to the Syrian Bab al-Hawa Office, Turkey will permit all Syrians living in the 10 provinces affected by the earthquake, to cross the border for a period of up to three months before returning. Hundreds more victims from Syrian regime-held areas have been laid to rest in Turkey considering they, even in death, cannot cross the frozen front line to the villages they once fled from.

Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist critical of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed by Saudi agents inside the country's consulate in Istanbul. The head of Amnesty International accused Turkey of ""betraying"" him. The move comes as Turkey seeks to repair its relations with the Gulf kingdom. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the TV channel A Haber in an interview on Thursday: ""I can say that concrete steps will be taken on this issue in the coming period."" He also highlighted what he called ""better co-operation"" between the Turkish and Saudi judiciaries. Ties between the two regional powers deteriorated significantly following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and led to an unofficial Saudi boycott of Turkish exports. The Washington Post journalist was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October 2018. She made that judgement after listening to purported audio recordings of conversations inside the consulate made by Turkish intelligence. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan alleged that Khashoggi was ""killed in cold blood by a death squad"" sent from Riyadh, and said it had ""been established that his murder was premeditated"". Turkey rejected the outcome as ""scandalous"" and for almost two years a court in Istanbul has been trying 26 Saudi officials in absentia on charges of premeditated murder or destroying evidence. The Turkish prosecutor said on Thursday that the case should be transferred to Saudi judicial authorities because they had promised to evaluate the accusations against the defendants. The court said it would ask for the Turkish justice ministry's opinion and adjourned the trial until 7 April. This time Turkey is betraying #JamalKhashoggi and justice.

Turkish officials said that a team of 15 Saudi agents, assisted by three intelligence officers, arrived in Istanbul in the days before the murder, and that the group removed the security cameras and surveillance footage from the consulate before Khashoggi's arrival.

Ebubekir Sahin, chairman of Turkey’s television watchdog RTUK, announced the probe on Tuesday night in a statement, describing Ataturk as “our most important social value”. The Armenian National Committee of America (ANCA) called on Disney+ in June to cancel the show, saying that it “glorifies a Turkish dictator and genocide killer”. Last month, Disney+ Turkey announced the Ataturk series would be on air “very soon”. Several Turkish and Armenian news reports said Disney had decided to cancel the series, including the Armenian independent media outlet 301, saying the decision was influenced by the lobbying activities of ANCA. In May 1915, Ottoman commanders began the mass deportation of Armenians from eastern Turkey. Turkey has disputed the number, but acknowledges that killings did take place. However, Turkey has said that deaths occurred on all sides in the context of the conflict going on at the time, and refuses to recognise the deaths as a “genocide”. Mustafa Kemal – later known as Ataturk – was a commander at the Gallipoli campaign of World War I in 1915, and later went on to establish the Republic of Turkey in 1923, after he ended the Ottoman Empire.

The Turkish lira, which has devalued steadily in recent years including halving in value in one year alone, dropped close to a historic low as markets opened the morning after Sunday’s vote. “Instead, there is now a very real risk that an Erdoğan victory could lead to macroeconomic instability in Turkey, including the threat of a severe currency crisis and strains in the banking and sovereign debt positions further down the line.” Turkey is the world’s 19th largest economy, according to the World Bank. It has noted that the Turkish economic crisis of the past five years has been accompanied by efforts to support economic growth “with credit booms and demand stimulus”. Economists from Bloomberg estimate the Turkish central bank has spent more than $177bn supporting the lira since December 2021. The Turkish Inflation Research Group (ENAG), which measures inflation on a basket of goods and services, recorded a 105.19% price increase last month on the previous year, adding that prices were up by almost a third compared with the beginning of 2023. The price of onions, a staple in Turkish cuisine, quickly became a talking point in the election after Kılıçdaroğlu released a video last month stating: “Now, one kilogram of onions is 30 liras, if [Erdoğan] stays it will be 100 liras.” We have already fixed problems in Turkey,” he said. The US credit rating agency Fitch Ratings pointed to Turkey’s dwindling foreign reserves caused by attempts to stabilise the lira, forecasting difficulties for the next government. The prospect that members of Turkey’s six-party opposition coalition could secure victory in order to restore international confidence in the Turkish economy and return to more orthodox economic policies appeared increasingly unlikely. Speaking before the first round of voting, the economist Bilge Yılmaz, of the nationalist IYI party, said Turkey’s economic crisis potentially outstripped anything the country had endured in decades. “Turkey right now is deprived of foreign capital because it’s not predictable, it’s not trustworthy … there are effectively zero dollars left, for all practical purposes zero,” he said.",NEGATIVE,0.9985174536705016

In the three weeks since the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, was re-elected to begin his third decade as leader, the value of the lira has tumbled, falling an estimated 16% against the dollar after the first round of the elections in mid-May, according to the Fitch ratings agency. The lira halved in value two years ago and inflation is officially at 39.59%, although unofficial estimates from Turkey’s Inflation Research Group put it at more than 100%.

Over the past 50 years, 60% of Turkey’s 300 natural lakes have dried up and the loss is devastating for birds and other wildlife. Other experts have blamed emissions from coal power plants as a contributing factor – Turkey is among the main contributors to Europe’s air pollution levels. According to the UN, Turkey is highly vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. Many think of Turkey as Europe’s rubbish dump, as plastic waste is exported there for recycling, but much of it ends up illegally dumped, burned or left to pollute the seas. Another lake in eastern Turkey, Lake Akgol, completely dried up this year. Aside from drought and rising temperatures, one of the biggest challenges facing Turkey’s water supplies is that, with the ground so dry, farmers are rerouting water sources for their land and animals. Poor agricultural practices, along with the use of lake water for large construction projects, and pollution, mean that wetlands are drying out – and they are a key habitat for migratory birds that come to Turkey from central and north Africa each spring to breed.

In a new report, HRW accuses the Turkish government of exacerbating the health and environmental impact on the workers by failing to enforce laws that require strict licensing and regular inspections of recycling centres. The EU, the biggest plastic waste exporter to Turkey between 2017 and 2021, and the UK, the largest single plastic exporter during the same period, were also contributing “significantly” to health and environmental rights abuses in Turkey, the report said. After China banned plastic waste imports in 2018, the EU’s plastic waste exports to Turkey skyrocketed by 1,200% from 38,804 tonnes to 446,432 tonnes in 2021. Krista Shennum, Gruber fellow at HRW and the report’s lead researcher, said: “The government of Turkey is failing to implement its laws. “Europe’s wealthiest countries are sending their trash to Turkey, consigning some of Turkey’s most vulnerable communities, including children, refugees and migrants, to serious environmental and health risks,” she said. “We call on the UK, the EU and other countries to manage their own waste domestically rather than exporting it to Turkey, where it is causing human health and human rights harms.” Turkey should reinstate the ban on plastic waste imports it imposed in July 2021 but then quickly lifted, she added. In Turkey, it is illegal for anyone under 18 to work in hazardous waste facilities, including in plastic recycling facilities. Yet HRW, which interviewed 64 people in the southern Turkish city of Adana and Istanbul, including 26 who now work or have previously worked in plastic recycling facilities, found a third had either begun the work as children or were children when interviewed. Researchers found that workers in Turkish recycling plants included refugees and undocumented migrants. Many facilities were “dangerously close” to homes, schools or hospitals, in contravention of Turkish laws and environmental regulations, the report found. The Turkish ministry of labour and social security told HRW it had undertaken 105 inspections of plastic waste recycling centres between 2017 and 2021, with 26 found to be breaking the law.",NEGATIVE,0.9984291195869446

It’s time to play hardball,5 Feb 2023 09.00 CET,"That Turkey is a “vital strategic ally” of the west is the sort of truism on which people such as Joe Biden and Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, are raised.

Turkey’s reliability and usefulness as a trusted western ally is almost at an end. As the most important Turkish elections in a generation move towards a febrile climax in May, and as the western democracies contemplate critical choices in Ukraine, over Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and in Iran, Syria and Israel-Palestine, these dilemmas boil down to one basic question: is it time to admit that two-faced Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is no friend of the west – and punish him accordingly? Using Turkey’s Nato membership for domestic political ends is a typical Erdoğan gambit. Turkey’s trade with Russia grew by nearly 200% in the six months after the invasion, including higher energy imports. Human rights abuses aside, Erdoğan has made a huge mess of Turkey’s economy. And if Erdoğan has his way, he will soon be joined by Ekrem İmamoğlu, Istanbul’s popular mayor and a leading light of the main CHP (Republican People’s party) opposition. US senators suggest that Ankara may be denied F-16 fighter jets promised by Biden if it continues to sabotage Nato. They should remind Erdoğan that Nato is a community of values as well as rules; welcome Sweden and Finland into the alliance via a vote of all 30 members; and suspend Turkey’s membership, if necessary by amending the North Atlantic treaty.

With the hostility showing no signs of abating, Greek government officials say migrants have become ever more weaponised by Turkey, itself host to about 3.8 million Syrian refugees, amid growing consternation in a nation where the economy has nosedived in recent months. “From what it seems, Turkey does not want to investigate [the incident] because it knows [what really happened],” Mitarachi said in Monday’s TV interview.

Turkey: PKK claims responsibility for Ankara suicide bombing Turkey says its warplanes have carried out raids on Kurdish targets in northern Iraq following a suicide attack on a government building in capital Ankara. A Turkish interior ministry statement on Sunday said about 20 targets of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) group were “destroyed” in the aerial operation, including caves, shelters and depots. Iraqi President Abdul-Latif Rashid on Monday said in an interview with Saudi Arabian state-owned broadcaster Al-Hadath that his country does not accept the repeated Turkish strikes or the presence of Turkish bases in the Kurdistan region and hopes to come to an agreement with Turkey to solve this problem. It was not clear if the interview was filmed before or after Turkey’s latest strikes. Sunday’s strikes came hours after a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device near an entrance of the interior ministry building in Ankara, injuring two police officers. The PKK is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. According to the state-run Anadolu Agency, the two attackers had seized the vehicle from a veterinarian in the central province of Kayseri, a city 260km (161 miles) southeast of Ankara. The suicide attack occurred hours before the Turkish parliament was set to reopen after its three-month summer recess with an address by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the blast was “the latest attempt” to inflict terror on the Turks. The PKK and ISIL (ISIS) have carried out such attacks in tourist areas and city centres of Turkey in the past.

Sangeen, who fought the Taliban during five years as a soldier in the Afghan national army, says that in the past month he crossed the Turkey-Iran border, about 50 miles to the east of Van, on three other occasions. Each time, Turkish border forces caught him and deported him back to Iran, he says. Violent “pushbacks” against refugees have surged in eastern Turkey in the months since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, according to an investigation by the Guardian involving interviews with several pushback victims, human rights lawyers working in the region and independent observers. According to Orhan Deniz, a professor of migration at Van Yüzüncü Yıl University, many are attempting 1,400-mile journeys through Iran and the Zagros mountains to the Turkish border and into towns such as Başkale, Çaldıran, Saray and Özalp. But Mahmut Kaçan, a Turkish lawyer based in Van who specialises in refugee and asylum cases, claims that pushbacks, which are in breach of the UN’s 1951 refugee convention, are “systematically” taking place. “What Turkish authorities are doing is illegal.” The Turkish government’s efforts to keep out refugees from Afghanistan escalated in August when construction began on a 183-mile concrete wall in Van province. Metin Çorabatir, president of the Ankara-based Research Centre on Asylum and Migration (IGAM), said the refusal to allow many Afghan refugees to enter Turkey legally was forcing them into deadly journeys, citing an incident where up to 60 Afghan refugees drowned crossing Lake Van. Sangeen, who fled Kabul two days after it fell to the Taliban in August, said that the mountains were strewn with dead bodies when he crossed into Turkey. He said thieves stole $150 from him and Turkish border forces smashed his phone on his head, burnt his clothes and kicked him repeatedly in the face.

Turkey's leader has until now insisted on keeping interest rates down. Inflation is almost 40% and Turks are in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis. The head of Turkey's central bank, Hafize Gaye Erkan, 44, was only recruited from the US this month in the wake of Mr Erdogan's re-election as president. Although the increase almost doubles Turkey's policy rate to 15%, it is far less than many economists had forecast. President Erdogan's problem is that Turkey's inflation rate remains stubbornly high and its central bank's reserves have fallen to critically low levels, after it spent billions of dollars trying to prop up the lira. Turkey's economy grew dramatically in the early years of President Erdogan's leadership. In the past five years, the Turkish currency has lost more than 80% of its value and foreign investment has plummeted. Turks are now trying to move foreign cash out of local banks. Mehmet Kerem Coban of Kadir Has University said Turkey's economic model needed capital to survive because its reserves had melted away. Although the rate hike was intended to stabilise the Turkish lira, investors appeared unimpressed and it continued to slide against the dollar. Mr Erdogan has been in power in Turkey for more than 20 years.

In recent days, Turkish authorities have accused Syrians of ""inciting hatred"" for eating bananas in a ""provocative"" way. In a climate of increasing hostility towards Turkey's large Syrian community, bananas have became a symbol of division. The banana challenge was inspired by a viral video of a heated discussion between Syrians and Turks about the dire economic situation in Turkey. Turkey's economy has suffered from high inflation that has eroded living standards. In the video, conflicting views were shared and a young Syrian woman, in fluent Turkish, defended the work ethic of refugees. In response, frustrated Turks suggested Syrians and Afghans were taking their jobs. Such opinions are not uncommon in Turkey, which hosts the world's largest refugee population, including 3.6 million Syrians. Anti-migrant sentiment has been rising, with a number of nationalist Turkish politicians campaigning for harsher restrictions. But what made this video go viral was what one Turkish man said: ""I see Syrians in the bazaar buying kilograms of bananas, I myself cannot afford them."" This claim, which caused debate among the Syrian community in Turkey, quickly turned into a viral soundbite on TikTok. Poking fun at the Turkish man, Syrians filmed themselves eating bananas, using banana filters, and sharing banana memes. One photo that replaced the Turkish flag with a banana particularly rankled. The newly founded nationalist Victory Party issued a complaint against Syrian TikTok users for ""insulting the Turkish people and their flag"". Other critics on social media said the videos were ""mocking the grave economic situation Turks are facing"". At a time of economic woe, the banana videos apparently irked Turkish authorities, too. Last Thursday, local media said Turkish police had arrested 11 Syrians who published banana videos, accusing them of ""provocation and inciting hatred"". The Turkish Migration authority said it would ""deport them after the necessary paperwork is taken care of"".

At his press conference on Monday, he made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, initially hoped that something had got lost in translation after she had been quoted in the Turkish press saying the Turks regard all Kurds as terrorists. It was also being said that no early warning flares were sent up by Turkey’s Nato ambassador, Basat Öztürk. Eyal added: “Many of his demands about the PKK are part of a familiar Turkish tune. On Monday, the Turkish justice ministry identified six alleged PKK members it is seeking to extradite from Finland and 11 from Sweden. Add in people accused by Turkey of supporting the US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt, and Turkey wants 12 people returned from Finland and 21 from Sweden. Nordic diplomats say this list was last presented in 2017 and has not been the subject of any Turkish lobbying in recent years. Turkish media has reported what it describes as other examples of a “soft” Swedish attitude to terrorism, including evidence that the Syrian branch of the PKK has held meetings in Stockholm hosted by the Swedish foreign office and the Olof Palme International Center, a thinktank funded by Swedish trade unions. Turkey also says that in 2019 PKK supporters held a protest in a shopping centre in support of the jailed leader Abdullah Öcalan and Swedish security forces did nothing to prevent them from carrying the PKK’s “flag” and pictures of Öcalan. Turkey’s 2017 purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defence system turned it into a pariah in the US and led to Ankara being kicked out of the F-35 stealth fighter jet programme.",NEGATIVE,0.9980266690254213

The veteran leader faces an election next year in which Turkey’s stagnating economy is likely to feature prominently, and his moves in the Middle East are aimed at boosting trade and investment ties that could ease the downturn.

Turkey’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has slammed the European Commission’s annual report assessing its long-stalled bid to join the European Union, saying it was unjust and biased. The report, published on Wednesday by the EU’s executive arm, accused Ankara of “serious backsliding” on democratic standards, the rule of law, human rights and judicial independence. “We categorically reject unfounded claims and unjust criticisms, particularly on the political criteria and the Chapter on Judiciary and Fundamental Rights,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement on Thursday. The Commission also said Turkey did not comply with the principles of the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms in its counterterrorism operations. The Turkish ministry said the allegations were unfair and highlighted “the insincerity of EU’s approach and a clear double-standard”, adding that fundamental rights issues were contentious even among EU member states. The Commission’s report is meant to update Turkey’s progress towards meeting standards for EU membership and could strain ties that are already troubled over immigration and, more recently, the war between Israel and the Hamas armed group in Gaza. Since Israel started bombarding the Gaza Strip on October 7, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Israel of “behaving like a war criminal” and blamed the West for being the “main culprit behind the massacre unfolding”. Turkey began talks to join the EU in 2005, but that bid has long been frozen due to rights concerns and foreign policy rifts. The EU has grown frustrated by Turkey’s stance on issues such as Syria, Cyprus, and Libya as well as its competing territorial claims with Greece to islands in the Aegean Sea.

Earlier on Saturday, Ankara cancelled a 27 January visit by Sweden’s defence minister, Pål Jonson, intended to be a discussion about Turkey’s refusal to ratify Sweden’s Nato accession. Turkey’s defence minister, Hulusi Akar, said the meeting was cancelled because it “has lost its significance and meaning”. Prior to Paludan’s event on Saturday, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, called it a “hate crime” that could not be characterised as freedom of expression, and asked Sweden not to allow the “vile act” to take place. Turkey has proved to be an obstacle to Sweden and Finland’s historic application for Nato membership after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which marked a reversal of the Nordic countries’ decades of neutrality. Sweden and Finland have gained the approval of 28 Nato members so far, bar Hungary and Turkey. But Turkey is still holding back, demanding the extradition of people in Sweden it claims to have links to the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) – designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU and the US – or to banned cleric Fethullah Gülen.",NEGATIVE,0.9978376030921936

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has warned that Kurdish fighters in Syria will either lay down their weapons or “be buried”, amid hostilities between Turkiye-backed Syrian rebels and other armed groups since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad earlier this month. Following al-Assad’s ouster on December 8, Ankara has repeatedly insisted that the Kurdish YPG militia must disband, asserting that the group has no place in Syria’s future. Turkiye views the YPG militia – the main component of the United States-allied Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) militia, which has waged a rebellion against the Turkish state since 1984. The PKK is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkiye, the US and the European Union. Ankara has repeatedly called on its NATO ally Washington and others to stop supporting the YPG. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said this is not a surprising statement by Erdogan “as it is the official rhetoric of the Turkish government”. Since the YPG is considered “the Syrian branch of the PKK, Ankara believes that they should either lay down arms, or they should fight and they will be defeated,” Koseoglu said. Earlier, Turkiye’s defence ministry said the armed forces had killed 21 YPG-PKK fighters in northern Syria and Iraq. SDF commander Mazloum Abdi acknowledged last week the presence of PKK fighters in Syria for the first time, saying they had helped battle ISIL (also known as ISIS) fighters and would return home if a total ceasefire was agreed with Turkiye, a core demand from Ankara. Erdogan also said Turkiye would soon open its consulate in Aleppo, adding that Ankara expected an increase in traffic at its borders in the summer of next year as some of the millions of Syrian migrants it hosts begin to return to their homes.",NEGATIVE,0.9978163242340088

A massive rescue effort is underway, with 13,000 more rescue workers, including volunteers, on their way from Istanbul. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that it was the worst disaster to hit the country since 1939, and in Syria, a volunteer with the White Helmets rescue group, Ismail Alabdullah, said: “We are used to digging people out of the rubble but this is different … There is nothing left, nothing at all.” For today’s newsletter, Ruth Michaelson, who has been covering the disaster for the Guardian from Istanbul, explains the confluence of factors that made it such a catastrophe. When the sun rose, it revealed a picture of devastation across south-eastern Turkey and north-western Syria. Within half an hour of the quake hitting, the governor of the Turkish city of Osmaniye had confirmed five deaths. “Turkey and Syria have suffered catastrophic earthquakes multiple times in living memory,” said Ruth Michaelson (who you can also hear on this morning’s episode of Today in Focus). “Everybody here remembers 1999 [when a quake hit Istanbul and killed 17,000]. “Even on Turkish TV news, you could see people trembling as they hit, watching the building quake, and trying to work out the right thing to do,” Ruth said. There have already been warnings in recent weeks that a snowstorm across Syria and parts of Turkey had left millions of displaced people at risk of freezing to death. In Turkey, Ruth said, “the problem of how to deal with earthquakes is something every government knows they have to be on top of. Even in Istanbul, which was unaffected this time, concerns over unregulated development and ageing building stock prompted warnings in 2020 that a major earthquake could leave 10% of the city’s 15m residents homeless. In a 2020 piece for catastrophe modelling firm Temblor, Istanbul-based seismologist Haluk Eyidoğan warned that in the south-east of Turkey, “stone masonry and adobe masonry structures in rural areas are weak, and the so-called reinforced concrete carcass multi-storey buildings are demolished in cities”.",NEGATIVE,0.9977014660835266

Turkey is also calling on Sweden to distance itself from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is regarded as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. Turkey also wants other political concessions, including the deportation of critics of Mr Erdogan, and Kurds that it claims are terrorists. Exacerbating tensions further, on Monday, Mr Erdogan said Turkish elections had been brought forward by a month to 14 May.

The prosecutor leading the case asked an Istanbul court on Thursday for the cases of the 26 suspects to be handed over to Riyadh and claimed there was little point in pursuing a trial in absentia. In the years since, Turkey had mostly maintained a hardline stance against Riyadh and demanded justice for Khashoggi as well as unspecified repatriations.

Anti-Syrian riots in Turkey: Violent protests spread to several cities Turkey’s government is urging for calm after violence against Syrian refugees broke out in the central Melikgazi region and spread to other areas. Riots erupted after Turkish authorities arrested a Syrian man for allegedly sexually abusing a seven-year-old Syrian girl in the central city of Kayseri. Turkish residents, infuriated by online reports of the crime, flipped over cars in Kayseri and set Syrian-run shops alight on Sunday night, demanding that Syrians be kicked out of the country. The riots “damaged houses, workplaces, and vehicles belonging to Syrian nationals”, said Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, who accused those responsible of acting “illegally in an attitude that does not suit our human values”. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the violence, which he blamed opposition parties for stoking.

But post-independence Greco-Turkish relations, between both Athens and Ankara and even more so in Cyprus itself, began to deteriorate. One of the main problems was that memories of what had virtually been a civil war where the British recruited Turkish Cypriots and some Greek Cypriots firmly believed in their Athens-backed enosis dream, were too recent. The archbishop began to make it plain that Cyprus was too close to Turkey to make union with Greece anything more than a dangerous dream.

The Alacasu and Bostanlık beaches, on Turkey’s southern Mediterranean coast in the province of Antalya, were part of Phaselis, a Greek and Roman settlement thought to be the birthplace of Plato’s student Theodectes. As sky-high inflation and a plummeting currency exacerbate an economic crisis, Turkey sees tourism as a lifeline. At Alacasu and Bostanlık, a report compiled by the Antalya branch of the Turkish Association of Archaeologists (TAA) identified “the potential to offer up significant archaeological information”. The culture ministry spent just 60,000 Turkish lira (£1,700) on archaeological research in the area in 2022, compared with more than 50m lira on construction. The Don’t Touch Phaselis campaign (Phaselis’e Dokunma Hareketi), set up by local people and supported by organisations including the TAA and World Wildlife Fund Turkey, took legal action and in June succeeded in temporarily halting construction.

On Wednesday, Muharrem Erkek, CHP’s deputy chair, said irregularities were found by the party in 7,094 ballot boxes after it checked more than 201,000 from within Turkey and abroad. Complaints over election irregularities are a common event during Turkish elections, and observers have pointed out that many of the discrepancies during Sunday’s vote may have been the result of errors in the CHP’s own system, rather than the YSK’s. Turkey’s presidential election will head to a run-off on May 28 after neither the incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan, nor CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu managed to win an outright 50 percent majority on Sunday. Speaking to journalists in Ankara on Wednesday, Erkek said extra votes were also given to Erdogan, without giving any evidence. That led to people posting discrepancies on social media, including instances in Turkey’s Kurdish-majority southeast where HDP/YSP votes seemed to have been transferred to the MHP. Although election campaigns in Turkey have been criticised for allowing the governing party an unfair advantage over its use of state resources, control of media and legal intimidation of opponents, the actual vote itself had been thought to be largely secure. Roman Udot, co-chair of Golos, a Russian election data monitoring watchdog now based in Lithuania, said a study of YSK’s data of previous Turkish elections revealed “very strange things”. “We found 3,500 polling stations where the turnout was more than 100 percent, over 800 percent in one case, which is mathematically impossible,” he told a news conference in Istanbul on Wednesday. He added that data from the 2018 polls showed the number of registered voters in Ankara being 3 percent lower for the presidential race than the parliamentary vote.

Six people died and 81 were injured when a bomb struck Istanbul’s popular pedestrian thoroughfare İstiklal Avenue, timed to strike when it was most crowded. Turkey’s justice minister, Bekir Bozdağ, said that “a woman sat on a bench there for 45 minutes”, and that the explosion occurred moments after she left. The Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said early on Monday the attack was planned in a Kurdish-majority city in northern Syria, blaming militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and the People’s Defence Units (YPG). While Kurdish militants and attackers linked to Islamic State (IS) have been blamed for attacks on central Istanbul in the past, the attack has not been officially claimed by any group so far. Ankara, Washington and the EU label the PKK a terrorist group, stemming from its decades-long insurgency demanding Kurdish self-rule in south-eastern Turkey. Istanbul police said that 46 people had been detained in total. The Turkish presidential communications chief, Fahrettin Altun, alluded to the potential impact on US-Turkey relations, stemming from Ankara’s long-term displeasure with the US backing of Kurdish groups in northern Syria. Soylu added that Turkey “will not accept messages of condolence” from the US concerning the attack. The PKK is also regularly targeted by Turkish military operations in northern Iraq, while Ankara has also blocked Swedish entry into Nato after accusing it of leniency towards the group. Turkey’s media ombudsman, RTÜK, placed a temporary ban on reporting of the explosion, preventing broadcasters from showing the moment the blast struck or the immediate aftermath, “to avoid broadcasts that may create fear, panic and turmoil in society and may serve the purposes of terrorist organisations”.

The currency has lost a staggering 25% of its value so far this year after a series of deep interest rate cuts by Turkey’s central bank, despite three years of double-digit inflation. Turkey’s insistence on slashing the benchmark interest rate, even as other central banks around the world use higher borrowing costs to try and put a brake on inflation, reflects Erdoğan’s belief that high interest rates, which he has termed “the mother and father of all evil”, fuel higher inflation. Contrary to the view of mainstream economists, since the lira began to nosedive in 2018 the president has placed an emphasis on keeping Turkey’s economy growing with the help of cheaper borrowing costs. While the economy had a record 21.7% year-on-year growth in the second quarter of 2021, middle- and low-income households – including much of the Turkish leader’s political base – are feeling the pinch. The government is reportedly preparing to raise the minimum wage and subsidise energy costs, but as Turkey’s elite profit from lower borrowing costs, widening financial inequality looks set to threaten the coalition’s chances in elections scheduled for 2023.

Turkish officials including the energy minister, Fatih Dönmez, said initial assessments indicated the blast on Friday inside the state-owned mine was caused by a firedamp explosion, a reference to the combustion of pockets of highly flammable gases trapped in the coal bed. The head of one Turkish mining union told the local Cumhuriyet news outlet that increasing safety measures after disasters was insufficient. “The important thing is to value people while they are alive,” he said, referencing two major mining disasters in Turkey in 2014. “There are mines all over the world, but these disasters always occur in mines in Turkey,” he said.

Indeed, Ottoman imperial history in the Arab world cannot be boiled down to a “Turkish occupation” or a “foreign yoke”. The Istanbul branch of the family, known as Azmzades, also held key positions in the palace, the various ministries and commissions, and later in the Ottoman parliament during the reign of Abdülhamid II and the second Ottoman constitutional period. The Malhamés were acting as commercial and political power brokers in cities like Istanbul, Beirut, Sofia and Paris. Some of them held positions that ranged from diplomats negotiating on behalf of the sultan with imperial counterparts in Europe, Russia, and Africa to advisers who planned and executed major imperial projects, such as the implementation of public health measures in Istanbul and the construction of a railway linking the Hijaz region in the Arabian Peninsula with Syria and the capital. These are also stories of better-known families like some of al-Khalidis and al-Abids, notable Arab-Ottoman political families who called Istanbul home, but maintained households and familial connections in Aleppo, Jerusalem, and Damascus. Their recent history was replaced by a short summary that painted “the Turk” as a foreign Other, the Arab Revolt as a war of liberation, and Western colonial occupation as an inevitable conclusion to the disintegration of “the sick man of Europe”.

In a joint statement released by the Turkish foreign ministry on Tuesday, the two governments said Turkey nominated Salih Mutlu Sen as its ambassador to Cairo and Egypt appointed Amr Elhamamy as its envoy to Ankara. “This step aims at the renormalisation of relations between the two countries and reflects the mutual will to improve bilateral relations in the interests of the Turkish and Egyptian peoples,” the statement said. Relations between Cairo and Ankara were severed in 2013 after then-military commander and current Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi led a coup to remove President Mohamed Morsi, a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, a political Islamist group active in multiple countries. Morsi, the country’s first democratically elected president, had the support of Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his conservative Justice and Development Party (AK Party), which was close to the Muslim Brotherhood. Mensur Akgun, a professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Kultur University, said ties between two key regional players have been exceedingly poor since the 2013 coup in particular because of Ankara’s unbending stance against the government of el-Sisi, who became president in 2014. Senior foreign ministry officials from the two countries have held talks since 2021, and rapprochement efforts between Turkey and Egypt took a turn after el-Sisi and Erdogan shook hands at the World Cup in Qatar in late 2022. Talks with Cairo were part of Ankara’s recent foreign policy initiative to repair relations with other regional powers, such as the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Before Ankara started efforts to fix its ties in the region, issues of disagreement between Ankara and Cairo included sharing hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean, the conflict in Libya, the war in Syria and a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf. Turkey backed Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Doha in June 2017 in a development that created clear rival regional alliances. Akgun said the resolution of the Gulf crisis in 2021 has been a catalyst for Ankara to repair its ties with regional powers. “Qatar and Turkey are key geopolitical partners, and Ankara would never enhance its ties with the blockading countries to its current levels if the Gulf crisis was not resolved,” he said.",NEGATIVE,0.9972659349441528

Erdogan was seen as vulnerable as Turks struggle through an economic crisis and after criticism of his government for a slow initial response to devastating earthquakes in February. “I was very hopeful before May 14 because it looked like we would finally get rid of him, but now it looks like he’s unbeatable,” said Olcay, who runs a clothing store in Cihangir, a fashionable district of Istanbul. Berk Esen, assistant professor of political science at Istanbul’s Sabanci University, said opposition demoralisation was to be expected. “I think we will see him starting another five years on the anniversary of 1453,” said Osman Cakir, a 22-year-old student from Istanbul, referring to Monday’s anniversary of the Ottoman conquest of the city.

Erdogan on Friday was due to attend a women’s meeting and a small rally in Istanbul before a television interview in the evening.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjer5ewr34jo,Leaving Syria's civil war to be a mercenary in Africa,16 Jul 2024," Unable to earn enough to support them, he, like hundreds of others, has decided to travel via Turkey to Niger to work as a mercenary. He is a member of Turkish-backed opposition forces that have been fighting President Bashar al-Assad for more than a decade. The faction he works for pays him less than $50 (£40) a month, so when Turkish recruiters appeared offering $1,500 a month to work in Niger, he decided it was the best way to earn more money. Since December 2023, more than 1,000 Syrian fighters have travelled to Niger via Turkey, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which monitors the conflict in Syria through a network of sources on the ground. Before they go, the official line is that the men will be protecting Turkish projects and commercial interests in Niger. Turkey has extended both its political influence and business operations in the region, selling equipment such as drones to Niger to help it combat militant jihadist groups. “We are mercenaries here and mercenaries there,” says Abu Mohammad, “but I am on a Turkish mission, I will not accept orders from the Russians.” The recruits we spoke to said their faction leaders had told them that a Turkish company called SADAT would look after them once the contracts were signed and would be involved in arranging their travel and logistics. The company added that it did ""not provide services to non-state actors"" but rather provided “consultancy, training and logistics services to armed forces and security forces in the field of defence and security according to the Turkish Commercial Code”. But private companies are used by the government in Ankara to recruit and send Syrian mercenaries to Niger, according to the SOHR. The organisation’s director, Rami Abdul Rahman, accuses the Turkish state of exploiting Syrians with no money and dire economic prospects. The BBC put these allegations to the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs, but we have not received a response. This is not the first time the Turkish government has been accused of sending Syrian fighters abroad.

Bilateral relations may be shaky but Turkey remains a highly strategic partner in the European Union’s 2016 cash-for-refugees deal (for which Steinmeier thanked Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Wednesday) despite recent reports about the deal’s unsustainability and the lack of transparency around the €6bn paid to the Turkish state for stopping refugees from fleeing towards EU territory.

The PKK said it had targeted Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) on Wednesday because the arms it produced had killed ""thousands"" of Kurds, including women and children. In a statement, the group said the attack, which also saw 22 people injured, was ""planned a long time ago"" - apparently rebuffing claims that the attack was an attempt to frustrate rumoured reconciliation efforts between the PKK and Turkish government. TAI is a key supplier for Turkey's military, providing its F-16 fighter jets. The Turkish government had previously implicated the PKK in the attack, identifying the assailants as PKK members Ali Orek and Mine Sevjin Alcicek. Turkey says it killed 59 ""terrorists"" in the strikes - though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said 12 civilians were among the dead, including children. The Ministry of Defence said Turkish forces had since killed more PKK militants. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country’s significant Kurdish minority. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the attack ""heinous"". TAI is a major player in Turkey’s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use. As well as being the Nato member's licensed manufacturer of US-designed F-16 fighter jets, the company also plays a role in modernising older aircraft for the Turkish military.

The total death toll now exceeds 46,000 – over 40,000 of whom are in Turkey. On Saturday, Turkey announced that it had ended rescue efforts in all but two of the hardest hit provinces, in the cities of Antakya and Kahramanmaraş. As time has gone on, shock around the disaster has turned into anger and frustration, with Turkish citizens accusing the government of evading accountability over poor building standards. I spoke to Dr Karabekir Akkoyunlu, a UK-based expert in Turkish politics and lecturer at SOAS University of London, about the impact the earthquake has had on Erdoğan’s chances for another term in office. “For instance, in the 2019 local elections, they managed to get the municipalities of Istanbul and Ankara out of the hands of the ruling party after 24 years, which was a huge setback for them.” Erdoğan’s falling popularity has, in large part, been because of Turkey’s weakening economy: the lira has been collapsing in value for years, recently hitting record lows against the dollar. And while inflation has fallen over the last two months, the average person in Turkey is unlikely to feel immediate relief as the country has consistently had some of the highest inflation rates in Europe – in October it reached a 24-year high of 85.5%. In October he unveiled what he called “the biggest social housing project in the history of the Turkish republic”, promising to build 500,000 new homes. “He started pulling these policies out of the bag even though they would obviously have huge costs for Turkey’s already empty state coffers,” says Akkoyunlu. Now, with a number of Turkish towns and cities reduced to rubble, the focus has moved back to what many are calling systemic corruption. While public opinion will change as the country starts to rebuild, and Erdoğan likely takes all the credit for getting Turkey back on its feet, the government will not be able to shake this crisis off, like it often has been able to in the past.

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was in northern Cyprus to mark 50 years since the invasion by Turkish forces, has said he sees no point in continuing United Nations-led negotiations on the Mediterranean island’s future. It is of no benefit to anyone to say let’s continue negotiations where we left off in Switzerland years ago,” Erdogan said in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) on Saturday. Northern Cyprus is a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey, and its Turkish Cypriot leadership wants international recognition. Erdogan attended a military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkey launched its offensive. Cyprus has since been split by ethnicity, with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living on either side of a UN-patrolled border. “Turkey is ready to negotiate, discuss, achieve lasting peace, solution in Cyprus,” Erdogan said, adding that both sides “should sit at the table as equals.” “Whatever Mr Erdogan and his representatives in the occupied areas do or say, Turkey, 50 years later, continues to be responsible for the violation of human rights of the entire Cypriot people and for the violation of international law,” Christodoulides said after a memorial service in the southern part of Nicosia in Europe’s last divided capital. In May, Erdogan had told Mitsotakis that there were “no unsolvable problems”, including Cyprus, between their countries as the two leaders met in Turkey’s capital, Ankara. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force. In 1974, Turkey captured more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south.",NEGATIVE,0.9970068335533142

Among the protesters' slogans were ""Istanbul Convention saves lives"" and ""We don't accept one man's decision"". Women's rights activists, lawyers and opposition politicians have denounced Mr Erdogan's decree, insisting he cannot legally take Turkey out of an international convention ratified by parliament. Women are killed in Turkey every day and critics argue that this move puts women in even greater danger. According to Turkey's We Will Stop Femicide Platform, at least 300 women were murdered in 2020, mostly by their partners, and 171 more women were found dead under suspicious circumstances. Turkey was the first state to ratify the convention, by a unanimous vote in the parliament in 2012, and it was actively supported by the Women and Democracy Association (Kadem), whose vice-chair is President Erdogan's daughter. He even praised the convention at one point as evidence that Turkey was a leader in gender equality. President Erdogan's spokesperson, Fahrettin Altun, argued that the Istanbul Convention's original intention of promoting women's rights had been ""hijacked by a group of people attempting to normalise homosexuality"" and that it was incompatible with Turkey's social and family values. To quell the critics, senior AKP members announced they would deal with domestic violence through judicial reform and an Ankara Convention that would claim its power from ""traditions and customs"". The change further weakened the Turkish lira. Whatever the rationale may be, there is a sense that the man who has dominated Turkey since 2003 is seeking to consolidate his conservative support base as opinion polls signal discontent among voters.

Incidents of stone-throwing, physical attacks on election workers and gunmen shooting up party offices have all been recorded in recent weeks as Turkey heads towards knife-edge polls in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is seeking to extend his 20-year rule. In Turkey’s highly polarised political landscape, however, claims and counter-claims blur the facts surrounding incidents.

Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, who has been named as one of several vice presidents if the opposition wins, was pelted with stones from behind the bus. Fears of political violence are very real in Turkey, where many remember the late 1970s when thousands were killed by political gangs. The bloodletting was stemmed after a military coup in 1980 but re-emerged when the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) launched its armed campaign against the Turkish state in 1984. Ahead of elections in June 2015, a bombing of a rally of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) in Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey, caused at least four deaths and hundreds of injuries. Three years ago, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, now the main opposition candidate against Erdogan, was attacked by a mob while attending the funeral of a soldier in Ankara province. Erdogan also came close to being killed in a 2016 coup attempt that caused more than 280 deaths when rogue commandos stormed his holiday hotel in southwest Turkey.

Turkey’s election authority has reinstated a pro-Kurdish mayoral election winner in the eastern city of Van after the annulment of his victory provoked clashes. The Supreme Election Board (YSK) announced on Wednesday that it has overturned a decision by the regional election commission in eastern Turkey to remove Abdullah Zeydan, the candidate of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). The reversal is viewed as another boost for the Turkish opposition following Sunday’s local elections, which dealt a blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party (AKP), after their wins last year in the presidential and parliamentary elections. Zeydan had been arrested and jailed in 2016 after criticising the Turkish army’s air campaign against outlawed Kurdish fighters in the Kurdish-majority southeast. The removal provoked violent protests on Tuesday that lasted throughout the night across the province, which lies on Turkey’s eastern border with Iran. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 89 people were detained, for joining unauthorised rallies and chanting slogans in praise of a “separatist terror organisation”, referring to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) that has been blacklisted by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.

Turkey has introduced new building codes, requiring new construction to be earthquake resilient, not least following the 1999 Izmit earthquake in which over 17,000 people died, but these have often been loosely enforced in a country where over half of all buildings were put up illegally. Turkey went through the terrible 1999 Izmit earthquake […] Turkey had modern building codes within a few years of that earthquake. After a quake in 2011 in which hundreds died, Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, blamed poor construction for the high death toll, saying: “Municipalities, constructors and supervisors should now see that their negligence amounts to murder.” Architects and urban planners in the country have long warned that building codes related to seismic activity are insufficiently enforced and have been undermined by a controversial amnesty for illegal construction – introduced by Erdoğan’s own government – that netted Turkey some $3bn in revenues. “This extraordinary devastation is perpetuated by the persistence in repeating faulty urban policies and politically charged decisions like the 2018 zoning amnesty law,” said Prof Pelin Pinar Giritlioğlu, president of the Istanbul branch of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects. At the time of the amnesty, Turkey’s building experts warned that retrospectively licensing illegal buildings for a fee would have fatal consequences. “It will mean transforming our cities, notably Istanbul, into graveyards and result in coffins emerging from our homes,” said Cemal Gökçe, the chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers in 2019.",NEGATIVE,0.9967827796936036

Despite calls by Sweden to restart trilateral talks with Turkey and fellow applicant, Finland, on their Nato bids, Turkey’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it would be “meaningless” to hold further discussions.

Calling off talks between the countries, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Mitsotakis of deliberately antagonising Turkey when he addressed the US Congress during a visit last week to Washington. The decision to freeze Greek-Turkish contact ends what many had hoped would be a period of détente between the perennial foes after Mitsotakis held talks with Erdoğan in Istanbul in March. But the Turkish leader, who will run for re-election next year, said Mitsotakis had failed to keep his side of the deal. Making the historic 17 May address, the Greek leader stopped short of mentioning Turkey by name but warned Washington of the perils involved in fomenting instability in the region if arms purchasing agreements were adopted. His centre-right administration has announced a sevenfold increase in defence spending compared with last year against a backdrop of increased air incursions by Turkish jets. “There is no need to answer in the same way,” he said, expressing disbelief at the Turkish leader’s reaction to a speech that had, he claimed, not deviated from any of the positions Greece has long held. But a strategic shift in US regional ties has also played a role in creating disquiet among Turkey’s military and political establishment. Washington’s growing desire to see Greece as a “reliable” partner – expanding its military presence in the country and signing a mutual defence accord unprecedented in scope with Athens – has irked Ankara, analysts say, noting Erdoğan’s unpredictability. On Monday, the Turkish leader raised the issue, saying: “At this moment there are 10 bases in Greece.

After a highly-contested first round of elections on Sunday, Turkey is very likely heading towards a run-off vote on May 28 as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was hoping to secure a third term, has barely failed to secure the required 50 percent of votes, despite faring better than predicted. He and his closest competitor, Kemal Kilicdarolgu, will likely gear up to campaign over the next two weeks as Erdogan tries to extend his two-decade rule, and Kilicdaroglu hopes to launch Turkey on a “new path” with the backing of his six-party alliance. The final results from Sunday’s vote are expected to be announced by 3pm (12:00 GMT) on Monday, Al Jazeera’s Farah al-Zaman Shawki said from Ankara, with votes from abroad yet to be fully counted. With 99 percent of domestic ballot boxes counted, Erdogan had 49.92 percent of votes, with Kilicdaroglu trailing closely with 44.95 percent of votes, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency, which gets its numbers from Turkey’s Supreme Election Council. This would be the first run-off vote under Turkey’s new electoral system. Turkey transitioned from a parliamentary system to a presidential one in July 2018. The 1989, 1993, 2000 and 2007 presidential elections went to a third round, but both the voting and political systems were different from the ones in place in Turkey now.

Ekrem Imamoglu, of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), is seen in the video commending the “great steps” taken in public transport projects when the AK Party controlled Istanbul.

When the Turkish parliament passed a law in October 2022 to fight disinformation, critics said the bill, which criminalised “disseminating false information” with a prison sentence of up to three years, would stifle access to information and deepen online censorship. “We are faced with a type of disinformation that aims to influence the election results,” Oguzhan Bilgin, a TRT board member and director of the Istanbul-based Diplomacy Foundation, said.",NEGATIVE,0.9967064261436462

The Turkish Ministry of Trade said on Tuesday it will no longer send to Israel items in 54 categories spanning iron and steel products, jet fuel, construction equipment, machines, cement, granites, chemicals, pesticides and bricks.

He added Israel would take “measures that will harm the Turkish economy”, including banning some Turkish imports, asking United States-based organisations to stop investing in Turkey, and calling “our friends in the American Congress” to impose sanctions on Turkey. The announcement of the trade curbs came a day after Turkey promised “step by step” reprisals against Israel after it blocked Turkish cargo military planes from dropping aid over Gaza. “We will continue our support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters until the bloodshed in Gaza stops and they live in a free Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the basis of the 1967 borders,” Erdogan said on Tuesday, adding that Turkey has sent 45,000 tons of humanitarian aid to the region.

Turkiye has hit back at claims by the United States that it agreed to a ceasefire with Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, and has vowed to continue working to clear them from the territory – a military operation that was launched after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. A senior Turkish defence official on Thursday rubbished claims made by US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller that a Washington-brokered ceasefire between Turkish-backed rebels and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) around the Syrian city of Manbij had been extended until the end of this week. The SDF is supported by Washington in its fight against ISIL, but Ankara views it as a “terrorist organisation”, alleging links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has waged a four-decade armed rebellion on Turkish soil. On Thursday, the Turkish official described Miller’s statement as “a slip of the tongue”, saying it was “out of the question” for Turkiye to talk to the SDF, a group spearheaded by the People’s Protection Units (YPG), which is seen an extension of the PKK.

But Erdogan signalled no major shift in comments on Wednesday released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Finland became NATO’s 31st member in April after the Turkish parliament ratified its request, but Turkey has held off on approving Sweden’s bid. The officials in Ankara discussed what Finland and Sweden have done to address Turkey’s concerns over what it calls “terrorist” groups and their supporters living in the Nordic nations. Erdogan said earlier that the Turkish delegation at the meeting gave the message: “Don’t expect anything different at Vilnius.” Sweden’s chief negotiator said on Wednesday that Turkey and Sweden will continue their discussions but added there was no specific date. “But Turkey is not ready to make a decision yet and thinks that they need to have more answers to the questions they have.” Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too lenient towards groups that Ankara says pose a security threat, including Kurdish armed organisations and people accused of associations with a failed coup attempt against Erdogan’s government in 2016.

Abortion is legal on request in Turkey to all women up to the 10th week of pregnancy, and up to the 20th week for medical reasons. Yet Esra visited one hospital after another in Istanbul, trying to arrange a termination, and was turned away from them all. In Turkey, women’s right to access free and safe medical abortions is increasingly under threat. A study by Kadir Has university found that by 2020, there was not a single public hospital performing on-demand abortions in Istanbul. According to the survey, only eight of Turkey’s 81 provinces have at least one public hospital performing on-demand abortions, and only two of them have more than one. The Guardian interviewed more than a dozen Turkish women who had all had abortions in the last three years. “There is a de facto ban in many places,” explains Filiz, a nurse at a public hospital in Istanbul where abortions are not performed. “Under Turkish law, a doctor cannot tell a woman she cannot have an abortion, but refusal is very common, forcing women to go begging from hospital to hospital,” says Filiz, who prefers not to give her surname. This de facto ban appears to be shaped by the increasingly populist and hardline approach to abortion taken by the Turkish government. “We have increasingly seen hospital administrations put pressure on physicians to not practise abortions,” says Irmak Saraç, an obstetrician and member of the women’s commission at the Istanbul Medical Chamber. A year ago, she became pregnant and travelled to Istanbul to have an abortion. Ilknur was five weeks’ pregnant, and with the help of two friends called more than 20 public hospitals in Istanbul. “I even talked to hospitals in other cities near Istanbul but found nothing.” Across Turkey, some healthcare workers – including Filiz – are now attempting to help women access their right to a safe abortion, drawing up lists of medical staff still willing to carry out free abortions.",NEGATIVE,0.996567726135254

The Council of Europe, a 47-member bloc that upholds human rights, warned Turkey in September it would begin proceedings unless it released Kavala before a ministerial meeting next week.

Turkish officials have briefed no decision has been taken and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russia has received no official notification from the Turkish side about a closure. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases. Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention. The convention defines Turkish control of the straits as well as setting limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted. Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to the daily newspaper Hürriyet, stating that officials are discussing whether the conflict meets the definition of a war under the Montreux convention. “Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed”. Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions.

Turkey has blamed Kurdish groups for a recent deadly bomb attack in Istanbul. The US defence department said the Turkish attacks had ""directly threatened the safety of US personnel"" working in Syria to defeat jihadist group Islamic State (IS). The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed militia alliance dominated by the YPG, has accused Turkey of using the Istanbul bombing as a pretext to launch a long-planned cross-border offensive.

The most recent operation, in 2019, saw Turkey capture the area between the towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain before Russia brokered a ceasefire. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group, insisting that it is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The PKK has also denied involvement in the Istanbul bombing, which killed six people in the city's central Istiklal Avenue on 13 November.

With hopes of finding other survivors in the rubble fading fast, the combined death toll in Turkey and neighbouring Syria from the 7.8-magnitude quake surged above 37,000 and looked set to keep increasing. A young girl named Miray was recovered alive in the southeastern Turkish city of Adiyaman and crews were reportedly close to reaching her sister as well. Stories of near-miraculous rescues have flooded the airwaves in recent days, including many that were broadcast live on Turkish television and beamed around the world. Still, thousands of rescue teams – including Turkish coal miners and experts aided by sniffer dogs and thermal cameras – were searching pulverised apartment blocks for signs of life.

But the Turkish economy is in bad shape, and in his victory speech on Sunday night, Erdogan highlighted inflation as the primary problem facing the country. “Resolving the problems caused by the price increases and by inflation is the most urgent topic of the coming days,” he told supporters outside the presidential palace in Ankara. The value of Turkey’s currency, which the government had protected through selling foreign currency reserves, is dropping. Timothy Ash, a Turkey expert at London’s BlueBay Asset Management, said the currency’s current level was “just not sustainable”. But Emre Peker, Europe director at the Eurasia Group, said Erdogan is likely to see Sunday’s victory as an endorsement of his economic policies, which the president argues will make Turkey’s economy stronger in the long run. Peker added that Erdogan was motivated by a “desire to wean Turkey off its overall economic dependency on Western partners”. Turkey has been helped in recent months by money from Russia and Gulf countries. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have deposited billions of dollars with the Turkish central bank or set up multibillion-dollar investment funds. Russia has deferred payments for natural gas as well as providing billions towards Turkey’s first nuclear power station. “The current economic dynamics won’t be able to sustain Turkey’s needs,” Peker said. “Turkey will need more foreign inflows to manage its external payments and, given the negative interest rates, that’s hard to sustain.” Another subject requiring the president’s urgent attention as he starts his five-year term will be Turkey’s relations with its Western partners, in particular the issue of Sweden joining NATO. Turkey and Hungary are the only NATO members holding up Stockholm’s bid to join the defence alliance, made in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year. “We’re not ready for Sweden right now,” he said, citing Ankara’s concerns over Stockholm’s stance on what Turkey has labeled “terrorist” groups.",NEGATIVE,0.9962318539619446

The day after the earthquakes, Turkish authorities issued a directive allowing refugees in the 10 provinces to travel to other cities or provinces, except Istanbul, for up to 90 days if they could secure their own accommodation. But after many refugees fled to Istanbul in the first days following the quakes, the Directorate General of Migration Management revised its decision on a case-by-case basis, allowing families who had already arrived in the metropolis to stay for up to 60 days. “Turkey has some shortcomings in their legal systems as compared to other countries that have ratified the refugee convention without reservation,” he said. “Turkey’s interpretation of the refugee convention has placed limits based on geography – only Europeans in Turkey have the full right to seek asylum, but Turkey made an exception for Syrians, allowing them to become refugees once they are registered.” He added that Turkey’s decision on the movement restrictions was possibly related to the economic difficulties facing the country. “It may have been a way to limit the number of refugees drifting to Istanbul and other big cities,” he said. Syrian activists and human rights organisations have denounced the government directives as “inhumane” and “unrealistic”, saying refugee families would be unable to rebuild their lives in southern Turkey in such a short time. “This 60- to 90-day respite is not realistic because no long-term solutions will be in place by then,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director at Human Rights Watch.

Erdogan sought aggressive interest rate cuts, which the Central Bank of Turkey carried out, sending inflation to a 24-year peak of more than 85 percent in October before it dipped to near 50 percent in March. The ensuing cost-of-living crisis has gripped Turkish households and squeezed earnings and savings, bottoming out people’s purchasing power.

The biggest barrier for Afghans claiming asylum is the Greek government’s controversial decision to label Turkey a “safe third country” for people not only from Afghanistan but also from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Somalia and Syria. They keep saying we should return to Turkey, even if Turkey doesn’t take anyone back from Greece.” Amid renewed tensions with Turkey, the public order minister in Athens claimed last month that every night about 1,500 people gathered at the land border with Turkey were attempting to cross as a result of Ankara’s policy to “weaponise” migration and push asylum seekers into Greek territory. After the adoption of a controversial pact aimed at stemming flows between the EU and Turkey in March 2016, the influx dropped steeply. As patrols have been reinforced, with the help of the EU’s border agency Frontex, the number has fallen further in recent years, particularly arrivals on the north Aegean islands facing the Turkish coast, where most asylum seekers at the height of the crisis were located. Last week, Mitarachi insisted the government would continue to replace open-air camps on frontline islands, such as Lesbos, with barbed-wire encircled “closed controlled” access centres, and would push ahead with plans to extend a border fence along the Evros land frontier with Turkey.",NEGATIVE,0.9961651563644408

Most are pale white Akbaş dogs or Kangal shepherds, with their distinctive dark muzzle, pale golden coat and large bodies designed to herd livestock, although on the streets of Istanbul they are more commonly found lazing outside coffee shops, rotund and docile from a lifetime of treats. One particularly large and sleepy example that dozes outside an ice-cream shop on Istanbul’s main shopping street has become a local celebrity nicknamed “The Boulder”, complete with a string of rave reviews left by delighted tourists. The dog is marked as an Istanbul tourist attraction on Google Maps, which features a recommendation to avoid petting him. Despite their welcome presence on the streets in some parts, Turkey’s estimated 4 million stray dogs have become the focus of a furious national debate. In late July, Turkish lawmakers worked overnight to push through a last-minute bill they claimed would resolve the issue of stray dogs, quickly sowing the seeds of outrage among opposition groups and animal rights activists. The new law, called the “massacre law” by its opponents, requires already underfunded and crowded Turkish shelters to take in strays to be vaccinated, spayed or neutered before putting them up for adoption, adding that any that are ill or pose a risk to humans will be euthanised. The new law quickly proved just as divisive as the dogs’ presence, pitting Turks who view their country as a nation of animal lovers where street strays are treated well, against supporters of the state, who say decisive action is needed for public safety. At a protest in Istanbul, where police quickly surrounded demonstrators to assess whether their placards met their approval, a large crowd chanted “get your hands off our animals”. “This is about much more than an animal rights issue … this is a war between the Turkish government and the oppressed,” she said, concerned that the authorities could seek to remove other minority groups from public life if this new law went unchallenged.

The alert came after the Turkish interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said his government would use the three-day event in Istanbul to persuade the international criminal police organisation’s officials and delegates to find, arrest and extradite Turkish dissident citizens – particularly those it labels terrorists – abroad. Turkish authorities have been accused of repeatedly swamping the police organisation with requests targeting political opponents. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, told the opening session of the 89th Interpol general assembly on Tuesday that he expected “strong cooperation” in the extradition of people suspected of following the US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen and the PKK, the Kurdish movement. Interpol has rejected almost 800 red notice requests from Turkey in the past five years, an Interpol spokesperson told the Guardian, insisting that each request was rigorously checked. But critics from the Turkish Democracy Project claim some exiles have been unjustly threatened with arrest and extradition by the organisation. In August, the Stockholm Center for Freedom, a non-profit advocacy organisation promoting the rule of law, democracy and human rights and focusing on Turkey, accused the Erdoğan regime of having “weaponised” Interpol for its wider campaign of repression against critics, human rights activists and ethnic or religious minorities abroad. It added: “Turkey abuses Interpol in various ways. “Turkey is also accused of manipulating Interpol’s Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database (SLTD) by filing tens of thousands of cases for critics and opponents who, in many instances, are not even aware that their passports have been invalidated.” Madeleine Joelson, executive director of the Turkish Democracy Project, said: “Interpol – once a bastion of law and order – has become a tool of transnational repression.",NEGATIVE,0.9961029291152954

Turkey lies on two fault lines and has earthquake building codes dating back more than 80 years. It required a massive rescue operation spread across 10 of Turkey's 81 provinces. More than 6,000 buildings collapsed and workers from Turkey's Afad disaster authority were themselves caught up in the earthquakes. Turkey has more experience of earthquakes than almost any other country but the founder of the main volunteer rescue group believes this time, politics got in the way. After the last major earthquake in August 1999, it was the armed forces who led the operation but the Erdogan government has sought to curb their power in Turkish society. Instead, Turkey's civil disaster authority now has the role, with a staff of 10-15,000, helped by non-government groups such as Akut, which has 3,000 volunteers. President Erdogan has accepted that search efforts were not as fast as the government wanted, despite Turkey having the ""largest search and rescue team in the world right now"". For years, Turks have been warned of the potential of a big earthquake but few expected it to be along the East Anatolian fault, which stretches across south-eastern Turkey, because most of the larger tremors have hit the fault in the north. When a quake in January 2020 hit Elazig, north-east of Monday's disaster zone, geological engineer Prof Naci Gorur of Istanbul Technical University realised the risk. One of Turkey's foremost earthquake engineering specialists, Prof Mustafa Erdik, believes the dramatic loss of life was down to building codes not being followed, and he blames ignorance and ineptitude in the building industry.

Erdoğan limited his interactions with the public in Pazarcık, instead driving directly to the local police headquarters to discuss the aftermath of the multiple massive tremors that left a trail of destruction over 10 Turkish provinces and across northern Syria, trapping people underneath collapsed buildings and killing more than 20,000. People who lined the streets of Pazarcık sobbing as they waited to see their dead relatives pulled from the rubble – rather than to catch a glimpse of the president’s motorcade – disagreed, as did those in other badly hit towns, who shouted angrily at Turkey’s infrastructure minister and a local official during a visit.

Instead, the message from the presidential palace appears to be one born of fear and control in the quake’s aftermath, amid reports that Turkey briefly blocked Twitter, which citizens had been using to locate lost loved ones amid the rubble.

The food fight began in April when Turkey applied to register the name doner as its “guaranteed traditional speciality” across Europe, meaning the label could only be used by those conforming to designated production methods and specifications for the meat inside. If Ankara’s application is successful, only beef and lamb “horizontally sliced into cutlets with a thickness of 3-5 mm” could be sold as doner. The age of the animals of origin and the knife for slicing would also have to meet distinct specifications, as well as the spices for marinating the meat, according to the application sponsored by International Doner Federation in Istanbul, which argues that the dish is an integral part of Turkey’s “culinary heritage”. Both Turkey and Germany, with its 2.7-million-strong Turkish diaspora, stake claims to being the birthplace of the doner kebab as it is now widely consumed. The delicacy of thinly sliced meat grilled on an upright rotisserie was introduced to Germany by Turkish migrants, who topped it with chopped vegetables and slathered it with garlic or chilli sauce. Its bicultural significance touched off a spat in Germany during a state visit by the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to Istanbul in April with a doner skewer in tow. If Turkey is successful in its registration attempt, the new rules would have “catastrophic consequences for gastronomy businesses as well as consumers,” Ingrid Hartges, head of the German Hotel and Restaurant Association, told local media.

The lira has flirted with record lows this week, but Turkey's long-time leader is pressing ahead with his ""economic war of independence"", backed up by low interest rates. So why is Mr Erdogan pushing a model that critics warn risks soaring inflation, higher unemployment and poverty, and what does it mean for Turks? The simple reason for the Turkish lira's collapse is his unorthodox economic policy of keeping interest rates low to boost Turkey's economic growth and export potential with a competitive currency. Annual inflation has surged above 21% in Turkey, but the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, overhauled by Mr Erdogan, has just lowered interest rates from 16% to 15%, the third cut this year. Turkey's economy is heavily dependent upon imports for producing goods from foods to textiles, so the rise of the dollar against the lira has a direct impact on the price of consumer products.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/turkey-new-disinformation-law-could-jail-journalists-for-3-years,Turkey: new ‘disinformation’ law could jail journalists for three years,13 Oct 2022 23.34 CEST,"Turkey’s parliament has ratified a sweeping new law that would see those accused of spreading disinformation jailed for up to three years. A coalition of 22 press freedom organisations said the bill “provides a framework for extensive censorship of online information and the criminalisation of journalism, which will enable the government to further subdue and control public debate in the lead up to Turkey’s general elections in 2023”. The new law means those found guilty of intentionally publishing disinformation or “fake news” that the authorities claim spreads panic, endangers security forces or the overall health of Turkish society could be sentenced to up to three years in prison. “It criminalises what the authorities call disinformation without defining what that actually means,” said the journalist Emre Kızılkaya, head of the Turkish branch of the Vienna-based International Press Institute, one of the organisations to condemn the bill. Journalists, press freedom watchdogs and even the Council of Europe condemned the bill as it slowly moved through its debate stages in Turkey’s parliament, urging the government to drop it before it became law. Turkey currently ranks 149 out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index for 2022, and campaigners fear these additional restrictions will affect the media’s ability to accurately cover Turkey’s forthcoming election, expected in or before June. Campaigners, including the Turkish Journalists’ Union (TGS), also criticised the government over the choice to consult American social media companies over the bill while failing “to seek the views of the journalism organisations in Turkey who will be directly affected”. Turkish authorities previously clashed with Meta, Facebook’s owner, over a demand that every social media company with more than 1 million users appoint a local representative required to answer to the government, and to store users’ data locally. “This will also force digital platforms like Google News or Facebook to reveal their algorithms to the government, showing the Turkish state what content they boost and what they suppress,” said Kızılkaya.",NEGATIVE,0.995692789554596

Paul T Levin, director of the Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, said the political mobilisation of Kurds in Sweden in recent years has been high, which has led to associations affiliated or aligned with the PKK becoming more prominent. Last week, days after Turkey approved Sweden’s Nato application, it was announced that public broadcaster Sveriges Radio would be shutting its Kurdish newsroom – along with its Russian and Tigrinya services – on 1 April.

The assault on state-run Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAS) has killed at least five and injured 22. It came a day after an unprecedented statement from a Turkish nationalist leader about the possibility of a renewed peace process with the country’s outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). The group – considered a “terrorist” group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union – has been fighting a 40-year-long rebellion against the Turkish state. Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya confirmed the attack in a post on X. “A terrorist attack was carried out against the Turkish Aerospace Industries Ankara Kahramankazan facilities,” he wrote. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Ankara, said a blast took place next to a security booth and may have injured security personnel. Kahramankazan an area to the north of Turkey’s capital, Ankara. Yerlikaya, the Turkish interior minister, confirmed that one of the assailants was a woman. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday night, Turkish National Defence Minister Yasar Guler alleged the PKK had carried out the attack. Turkey’s extreme-left Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) is also on the radar, according to Koseoglu. A peace process between Turkey and the PKK broke down in 2015, and the group and its affiliates carried out a number of attacks in the years that followed, as the Turkish military and security forces conducted operations against the PKK in southeast Turkey, as well as in Iraq and Syria. The number of attacks in major Turkish cities has dropped sharply since 2017. “This is more of a message that the Turkish defence industry can be targeted and harmed”, said Omer Ozkizilcik, non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Middle East Programs. “Turkish drones are a major game changer in the Turkish counterterrorism effort.

Turkish officials have said the criticisms are baseless. The committee claimed that from April 2014, Turkish officials turned a blind eye to the sale, transfer and enslavement of Yazidi women and children, and helped train fighters affiliated with IS to fight its Kurdish enemies in Syria, so strengthening the perpetrators of the genocide. “Turkish officials knew and/or were wilfully blind to evidence that these individuals would use this training to commit prohibited acts against the Yazidis,” the report said. The Turkish ambassador to the UK, Ümit Yalçın, said the criticisms were baseless and unfair.

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who is facing an election in a few months, said offers of aid to Turkey had come from 45 countries ranging from Kuwait to Israel, Russia and the UK. By Monday afternoon the number of dead in northern Syria had reached 840, about a half of the fast-rising death toll in Turkey of 1,541. Aid agencies reported that some of the roads from Turkey into Syria were blocked, including the main cross border crossing used by international aid agencies. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US was already assessing its comprehensive response options, “and had directed my team to remain in close contact with our Turkish allies and our humanitarian partners in the coming days to determine what the region needs”. Italy and Hungary have offered their rescue teams to Turkey as well.” Soldiers from Azerbaijan were the fist to arrive in Turkey to offer practical support sending 400 fully equipped soldiers.

Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said that at least three people were killed and 213 wounded by the latest quakes, after a large government hospital in the city of İskenderun in the north of Hatay province declared it was evacuating patients. One person was reported dead in the town of Samandag in Hatay by Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority AFAD. The latest quakes, less powerful than the 7.8- and 7.5-magnitude earthquakes that tore a path of destruction through southern Turkey and northern Syria on 6 February, threaten yet more devastation in a region where many people have fled their destroyed homes for the safety of other towns and villages outside the quake zone. It was centred near the southern Turkish city of Antakya and was felt in Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. Turkey’s disaster management agency AFAD said the epicentre of the larger quake was below the Defne district of Hatay, in a region where many have complained of a lacklustre government response to the first earthquakes. The mayor of Hatay, Lütfü Savaş, immediately raised concerns that the latest quakes had caused yet more destruction across the province, and potentially further loss of human life in a place already dealing with some of the worst devastation in Turkey. The death toll in Turkey from the quakes two weeks ago rose to 41,156 on Monday, AFAD said, and was expected to climb further, with 385,000 apartments known to have been destroyed or seriously damaged and many people still missing.

Ekinci, whose work focuses on the plight of Kurdish people in Turkey, has been charged with creating terrorist propaganda in relation to his book Rüyası Bölünenler (Dream Divided). He was charged under Article 7 of Turkey’s Anti-Terror Law No 3713, which is “routinely used to silence independent voices”, said PEN International on Monday. The first hearing in the case will take place at the 23rd high criminal court in Istanbul on 18 September. This is one of two cases related to Ekinci’s Dream Divided; a separate case saw an Istanbul court ban the publication, distribution and sale of the book in March 2023, and copies were confiscated. That case is pending before Turkey’s constitutional court. Dream Divided – published in 2014 and not yet available in English – tells the story of a Kurdish man who flees Turkey on political grounds and struggles to make a new life in Germany. Ekinci was born in 1979 in Batman, Turkey. He was charged over eight tweets published on his X account, “none of which promoted or incited violence”, according to PEN International, which has called on Turkish authorities to overturn the conviction. The cases against Ekinci are part of a “mounting crackdown” on books and social media content in Turkey, said PEN International, which urged authorities to stop “censoring and persecuting writers for the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression”.",NEGATIVE,0.9950159192085266

Turkey carried out more than 100 attacks between October 2019 and January 2024 on oil fields, gas facilities and power stations in the Kurdish-held Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), according to data collated by the BBC World Service. Turkey said it had targeted the “sources of income and capabilities” of Kurdish separatist groups it regards as terrorists. The AANES has previously accused Turkey of seeking to “destroy our people’s existence”. People living in the region have been caught up not only in Syria’s ongoing civil war but also in Turkey’s conflict with Kurdish-led forces, who established the AANES in 2018 after they - with support from the US-led coalition - drove the Islamic State (IS) group out of the region. Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has described the AANES - which is not officially recognised by the international community - as a “terror state” next to its border. The Turkish government considers the Kurdish militia that dominates the main military force there to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) rebel group, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The PKK is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the EU, the UK and the US. The UN says Turkish forces carried out the strikes in Swadiyah, Amuda and Qamishli, while humanitarian groups say Turkey was behind the attack in Darbasiyah. Turkey said it had been targeting the PKK, the People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). “Civilians or civilian infrastructure were not among our targets and have never been,” Turkey said in a statement to the BBC.

Haberturk television and other Turkish media said players from both Istanbul football teams wanted to wear T-shirts that featured an image of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered founder of the modern Turkish republic, during a prematch warm-up, but were not authorised to do so by Saudi organisers. Turkish media also reported that Saudi authorities did not allow banners featuring political slogans and Ataturk T-shirts to be displayed ahead of the match, including those with Ataturk’s “peace at home, peace in the world” slogan. “We had been looking forward to holding the match on time in accordance with the international football rules and regulations which require presenting the sport without any slogans outside its scope, especially since this was discussed with the Turkish [Football] Federation in the framework of the preparatory meetings for the match,” the statement said.

The castles were supposed to bring a welcome injection of Gulf money to this part of Turkey. On paper, it was a tempting pitch for prospective purchasers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain: a luxury development named Burj Al Babas (a nonsensical mashup of Arabic and Turkish, playing on the name of local hot springs). Then there was the location: a lush spot away from the intense 45C heat of Gulf summers, conveniently located between Istanbul and the capital Ankara, and only a short distance from Mudurnu’s peaceful town square and quiet streets of squat, Ottoman-era wooden houses. As the scandal has dragged on, it has sparked multiple lawsuits, one attempted suicide, a bitter vendetta between one contractor and the Sarot Group, and even a minor diplomatic incident between Turkey and Kuwait. The deserted castles have come to symbolise the financial problems and mismanagement that have dominated Turkey’s construction sector during president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s two decades in power. Alfahhad had contemplated buying property in Turkey before, but the idea of a holiday home in a castle, or at least something resembling one, was just too good to ignore. Where others dismissed them as kitsch, Alfahhad saw in the pointed turrets references to Istanbul’s Galata Tower and the Maiden’s Tower, both of which date back centuries. Even though the chateaux were close together, he felt they were perfect for someone like him who longed for the isolation of the temperate Turkish countryside. Mudurnu, like much of Turkey, is trying to weather high unemployment and an economic crisis that in recent years has seen Erdoğan turn to the Gulf, notably the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, for a bailout.

BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c937p1vzrx0o,Turkey strikes Kurdish sites after attack kills five near Ankara,24 Oct 2024,"Turkey's government says its military has struck sites in Iraq and Syria linked to Kurdish militant group the PKK, after blaming it for an attack near Ankara that killed at least five people. The Turkish government said that the strikes since Wednesday had killed 59 people it described as ""terrorists"". Various videos from the attack earlier on Wednesday show at least two people firing guns around the entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), which is located some 40km (25 miles) outside the capital. The Turkish defence ministry said that since Wednesday night and Thursday morning, its strikes had “successfully eliminated” 47 targets including caves, shelters, warehouses and other facilities in northern Iraq and Syria. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country’s significant Kurdish minority. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Thursday morning that Turkey had launched a ""new wave"" of attacks, including on ""civilian gatherings"", killing 12 people. According to the the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Turkish warplanes and drones targeted infrastructure in northern and eastern Syria. The watchdog said Turkish forces resumed attacks on Thursday morning, with targets including a checkpoint near a train station, a bakery and power station. The Turkish defence ministry said earlier that ""all kinds of precautions were taken to prevent harm to innocent civilians, friendly elements, historical and cultural assets and the environment"". Turkish Vice-President Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims of Wednesday's attack near Ankara were TAI employees, while the fifth was a taxi driver. The victims were named by Turkey's state-run news agency as Cengiz Coskun, a quality control officer, Zahide Guclu, a mechanical engineer, security guard Atakan Sahin Erdogan, another employee called Huseyin Canbaz and Murat Arslan, the taxi driver. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled"" by the attack in Ankara. In a post on X, he wrote: ""We stand shoulder to shoulder with Turkey as a Nato ally and close friend.""",NEGATIVE,0.9947488903999328

Many observers think that the political opposition in Turkey has its best chance yet of unseating the long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in May’s presidential election. The opposition – in all its many different forms, including defectors from among Erdogan’s closest allies – has come together in the past few years, and scored some notable victories, such as in the 2019 mayoral races in Istanbul and Ankara. And last month’s devastating earthquakes, which killed more than 45,000 people in Turkey, have led to questions over the government’s response, and the seemingly lax enforcement of housing regulations that are believed to have led to the collapse of so many buildings. And yes, as a member of the Alevi religious minority, he probably won’t appeal to many Turkish nationalists. But then Meral Aksener, leader of the opposition’s main nationalist bloc (there’s a pro-government nationalist bloc, too, stay with me) decided that, well actually, Kilicdaroglu wasn’t up to the job, and publicly announced that the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara would be better choices. A month ago, people went to sleep in their homes, not knowing the destruction that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake was about to bring to southeastern Turkey and northwestern Syria. They could possibly use the recovery plan from the 1999 Marmara earthquake, in northwestern Turkey, as a template for the rebuild, but at the same time, people in Antakya – historic Antioch – are worried that a rush to rebuild ancient sites will threaten the city’s identity and heritage.

Russian representatives reported to the meeting that Assad was inflexible, refusing to accept reality or the necessity of dialogue with Turkey, the country sponsoring the military forces threatening the capital. By contrast the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, also a former head of Turkish intelligence, surrounded by a vast entourage, said little in public, sensing his country may be the biggest external beneficiary of Assad’s fall.

He completely ignores the Turkish lira, he thinks crypto is the future.” Erdoğan spoke at the weekend about how he had lowered Turkey’s inflation to 4% before and promised to again achieve that 2011 level soon, but most economists see his approach as reckless and predict a rate above 30% next year. Many of Turkey’s leading financial figures agree, and the country has had four central bank chiefs in the past two and half years, while former finance minister Lütfi Elvan quit at the beginning of December. He repeatedly encouraged Turks to take their money out from under their mattresses and put it into banks. Despite economic reforms intended to lower labour costs and spur exports, Turkey also raised the minimum wage.

Most of his customers prefer dollars, so much so that some are changing Turkish marriage traditions and pinning foreign currency to brides rather than the traditional gold coins. “About 70% of the customers are Turks, buying in panic. Maybe they have debts they want to get rid of,” he adds, leaning in to whisper: “Turks are buying a lot.” Turkey’s stock market, the Borsa, was twice forced to halt trading to prevent further losses. “In Turkey, the root cause of the financial turmoil is the loose monetary policy itself.
